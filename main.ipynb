Over the years, it is becoming progressively complex due to innovations in financial markets, shareholder activism and influences from politicians and other stakeholders including financial press. Every day M&As are happening in the business world but only a few large ones are making media headlines. The Competition Commission’s intervention or NCLT’s ruling make further additions to the M&A news. M&As are the causes and results of corporate restructuring necessitated by both ups and downs of the national economy. The managements of the merging companies defend their M&A decisions. The employees become uneasy and skeptical about their future. The stock market reacts positively or negatively. While the overt motives behind many mergers are ‘growth’ through organic or inorganic combinations, the covert purposes can be driven by ‘managerial hubris’. But the fact remains; most M&As are failing sooner or later as the mysterious M&A chemistry is less understood. The failure rates are more in developing economies, even though successful CEOs strike the deals. Experts are unanimous in expressing that majority of failed mergers are the results of unscientific M&A decisions but it remains an exotic bets; win some lose some.    ,\n",

How is it related to science, technology and business? Is industrialisation driven from above (by governments) or from below (by entrepreneurs)? These questions are particularly important today as we face climate change and other environmental challenges.Such questions will be explored in this course through the history of industrialisation in several locations including Britain, continental Europe (especially Germany), the USA, Japan and India. A broad time-period will be covered, starting with the Industrial Revolution in eighteenth-century Britain and coming down to the present day. This is in accordance with newer approaches to the study of industrialisation, which look at the phenomenon on a global scale, rather than focusing on a few (Western) countries (Stearns 2012).,\n",

Stories captivate, entertain and motivate people. Storytelling is an age-old tradition that is also gaining popularity in the world of social media. Today the techniques are different, but the need to keep your audience, interviewer, reader, viewer, and the listener engaged till the end is of utmost importance. Being able to confidently tell your story at a gathering, a job interview, a business event, or on stage is a powerful and rewarding skill.\n",
      "PVA101 Undergraduate Exploring Studio Art 3 ['Rajesh Naidu', 'Ranu Roychoudhuri'] Winter None This course will enquire into the genres that have come to acquire the moniker “studio art” in contemporary art pedagogy. They include drawing, painting, sculpture, photography and printmaking. However, the category of \"studio art\" will be an entry point to think about spaces and sites beyond the studio per se and engage with broader questions of artistic productions spatially, temporally and politically. Indeed, contemporary art has pushed the boundaries of practices and sites of “studio art”, and this course will foreground this complex interplay between practice and space, in conjunction with social realities. Students will do hands-on projects in each genre that will form an introduction to specific studio art practices, while also learning their pre-modern and modern histories. \n",
      "PVA222 Undergraduate Seeing Photographs 3 ['Ranu Roychoudhuri'] Winter COM101 Effective Reading and Comprehension Skills Beginning with the supposed authenticity of photographs in objective visualization of events and the everyday, this course will explore the myriad ways in which meanings emerge from encounters between photographs and their beholders. These meanings are often contingent on the physical spaces and forms in which photographs meet their audiences. A single photographic image-object may acquire multiple meanings depending on its viewing location and its material form while also shaping the scope of those locations and materials. Closely analysing a wide range of photographs of events and the everyday from across cultures, this course targets to disentangle the analytical challenges posed by photographs’ materiality and their fluidity of meaning.,\n",
      "PVA224 Undergraduate Human Figure Study in Drawing and Painting 3 ['Rajesh Naidu'] Winter None The course is designed to study the construction of a human figure in visual arts, specifically in drawing and painting. Through focus on concepts of ‘contour’, ‘gesture’ and ‘structure’, students will learn how to draw a human figure both from direct observation and from memory, while also understanding the significance of a human figure in the global history of art through intellectual discourse. Students will learn to render a human figure through in-depth study of skeletal structure and muscles by using mediums including graphite, charcoal and paint (acrylic) and also paper and canvas as support. \n",

The course has dual purposes: One, it aims to acquaint students with selected forms and prac$ces in the Indian subcon$nent including those iden$fied as heritage (e.g. classical and folk per- forming arts, craTs, material culture, etc.) and as contemporary arts (e.g. paint- ing, installa$on art, etc.). Two, it encourages students to look cri$cally at the cat- egories of art, culture and heritage, and examine how they intersect with na$on- al/regional/global poli$cs, cultural ins$tu$ons, livelihoods, markets, legal regimes, etc.This is a core course for Minor in Heritage Studies and also serves as PVA GER.,\n",

Both highlight the urgency for us to act - as citizens and as scientists. However, how much do we think of water? How much do we know of this resource apart from what we have read in our school textbooks? Is the water crisis real? Are we taking the right decisions today to secure a better future for the coming generations? How can I, as an individual and as a community participate in the process? Also, as the driver for all forms of life on earth, water is an excellent solvent, however, this excellent solvent’s characteristic, when combined with its flow, makes it a potent carrier of pollutants and pathogenic microorganisms that are often harmful to health. So, what makes water safe to consume and use for many other purposes? Is the water in surface and groundwater bodies in the Ahmedabad area safe for all forms of life? Is it potable? This course will turn students into aware citizens of the country by enabling them to ask relevant questions around the subject of water.                                        ,\n"
