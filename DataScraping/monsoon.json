An organization with a project culture is one that knows where it is going, is focused on results and has a professional team who knows what is expected of them. Professionals & organizations working or desiring to start a new venture in diverse fields require an understanding and insight of Project Management concepts and methods. Projects are vital and often businesses and various functions start with this management operation. Initial activities within a function also start with projects, for eg. Launching a new product in the market or implementing ERP within the organisation. The products are developed at lab scale, tried at pilot scale and produced at plant scale. To handle all these activities later in their careers, management students have to learn Project Management techniques and through planning and control techniques to execute projects. ,",

Design is a set of activities and processes to bring about this improvement and beneficial change on their own. Design Thinking is a set of activities and processes to let design happen on its own. It is aimed at making designerly behaviour a very core mindset and bodyset.Design Thinking in the modern context is recognised as a core business activity which is capable of enhancing all activities around it, making them better and more human and consequently profitable as well. Over the years, it has developed as a very robust and ever-evolving combination of design, science, human behaviour and business principles. At the centre of this is the target user for whom systems are built to understand them, empathise with them define their problems and help them solve these problems through strategically targeted design interventions. Ultimately, all business is about the people who invest in it through one or the other level of consumer behaviour. Design Thinking is aimed at giving business thinkers, a very deeply strategic advantage in the market.The proposed course is an introduction to Design Thinking which is delivered through a set of 14 sessions, discussions, and structured assignments that help internalise these basic concepts. Several minor assignments and a major project serve as a vehicle for participative action that is central to the understanding of Design Thinking as applied to imaginative business models while understanding four key aspects \u2013 context, intent, recipients of the design and the system involved.,",

It is also important for individuals who create any original work, be it in the scientific, literary, or cultural domain. Intellectual property rights are considered monopolistic rights, but the monopoly is a limited one as the IPRs will go in the public domain after a certain stipulated time. The ethical implications of the IPRs will be discussed and deliberated during the course through various case studies where monopolistic presence versus the social benefits are in conflict especially pharmaceutical products and/or utilitarian goods. The course will familiarize students with the popular types of intellectual properties and the legal provisions related to them and the administrative remedies which can be sought for. With the advent of technology, intellectual property protection has become a challenge due to piracy. The course deals with the technological solutions to the sustainable inventions and whether they can be protected through IPRs or not he course also looks into the contemporary issues of Intellectual Property rights in the global context. The course will also provide insight into the competitive and strategic advantages of enterprises by using Intellectual Property Rights .,",

In these contemporary times, managers are challenging the accepted results of a traditional understanding of behaviours. The idea of how behaviour contributes at business, society, and technology levels is changing. The idea of behaviour lab is to deliver behaviour to look at businesses, areas, and domains affected by it. Addictive behaviour, Networks, Irrational decisions, Mapping behaviour online are the newer areas where behaviour\u2019s application has become more relevant. This also means developing skills to understand, analyse and apply behaviour in other areas that are not just restricted to Businesses. Thus, learning behaviour with a more interdisciplinary focus and having skills to understand and analyse them. Consequently, such skills facilitate a person to survive what waits for them in the professional world. Workplace challenges, often fuelled by a keen intuition, can now form the basis of experiments that allow us to understand the processes, decisions, communities and how they work in tandem to achieve or/ and survive changes. Behaviour Lab equips students with tools, methods and interventions aligned with these changes and also help them later in their journey in the business world. Moreover, the course makes them aware of how the behaviour domain is contributing in areas that were untouched earlier.,",

It is one of the important financial pillars of the financial system, which plays a vital role in the success / failure of an economy. The banking sector is dominant in India as it accounts for more than 60 per cent of the assets of the financial sector. Banking had traditionally remained a protected industry in India. A series of reforms were undertaken based on the recommendations of the Narsimham Committee post 1991. A variety of developments have compelled banks to change the ways of doing business.                                This course attempts to provide a glimpse of some relevant areas that need further attention both from the industry and the academic perspective. ,",

        "Description": "'Business-model' is a buzz word now in boardrooms, especially when the business encounters problems. The managers agree or disagree if the present business model is working any more or it needs navigation. To put it simply, a business model is both a short- and long-term framework of plans and moral rules within which a business operates. If the business model is strong it creates value and business prospers. Reverse happens when the business model is week. Over a period of time, an existing business calibrates its business model in keeping with the surrounding changes to remain relevant otherwise it may perish. A carefully designed business model has an inherent strength but it may not be long lasting. Hence, calibration is necessary from time to time. A rightly calibrated business model can act as a game changer. Today\u2019s business models were imagined a decade ago and we have to create tomorrow\u2019s business model considering many unknown bets.  Therefore, formal education and intelligent hard work are necessary to create a winning business model. Even though there are some generic and popular business models developed by experts, the owners and managers can bypass the standard ones and create a differentiated business model most suited to their businesses. This course mainly deals with identifying and placing various business drivers in sequence and changing it whenever and wherever necessary in order to make competitive business models.\u00a0,",

        "Description": "Brands exist in the consumers\u2019 minds and yet entice them to act as if it were a relationship of the heart.Brands often look for top-of-mind recall, but branding is an emotional connection that the audience forms with the brand and its message thereby creating a loyal following. It is not what you think and says but what they (the audience) perceive and believe. Therefore, branding is a function of strategy and psychology that embeds various facets of design in it.This course is designed to cover the fundamentals of branding and packaging to sensitize you to the decision-making process required to create a cohesive brand language. In a world dominated by brands, it is important to understand the key differentiating factor and then build an experience around it. Strategic Packaging design directly contributes to building a brand image by functional or aesthetic elements or by reinforcement of brand image by giving out an experience. This course will offer the tools and techniques required to formulate the right strategy for success.The pedagogy consists of interactive sessions with a healthy mix of fundamental theory, case studies, on the spot, and group assignments for hands-on learning.Your key takeaway from this course will be the ability to make smart decisions for building a successful brand image and a long-term plan for a lasting brand impression.,",

There are many examples of good designs which have been inspired by nature. Biomimicry is studying elements from nature: form, colour, function, movement, life cycle, growth, etc. and using it as an inspiration for designing products, spaces, visuals for communication, systems, etc.Today in our modern world and our way of life, we are moving away from our natural connection with nature. It is all the more critical that we study its various inspects to learn and use it as an inspiration for good design. The whole area of Biomimicry, Bionics, etc, has developed a lot and there is a lot more awareness about this field in current times. Toys are also recognized today as playing an important role in learning, development, building cultural connect and socio-emotional bonds and as part of the entertainment sector. Toys are a part of unstructured play and a means to create playful experiences.  In this course, we will study nature with a new perspective and explore possibilities of using it to ideate and design toys or playful elements.,",

So, why do so many products and services fail to achieve this ideal? All products, whether digital or otherwise, must deliver a high-quality user experience or risk losing users to competitors.The focus of interaction design is on user-centred design based on the understanding of real users including their experiences, goals, needs, wants and tasks. The goal of interaction design is also to collect and analyse data to make informed interface design decisions which are critical to creating and delivering successful products, services and systems that fulfil the user/customer, technological and business needs. ,",

In this introductory course, we will explore a set of influential contemporary moral theories, and learn how these can be applied to some of the most pressing moral issues of our time. We will address some aspects of the following questions. Is there a criterion for distinguishing between right and wrong? Are morals culturally relative? What is the best human life? What might be the moral bases for accepting or rejecting practices like euthanasia, abortion, affirmative action, and civil disobedience? To what extent are we obligated to assist people in need? How ought we to treat animals? What might an ethical relationship between nations look like? Finally, we will discuss a subset of key ethical issues relating to the fields of engineering, business, and bioethics.,",

It aims to build upon the important accounting concepts and principles including revenue recognition, inventory, depreciation, and understanding the accounting equation. The course focuses initially on how to record economic events in the accounting records (i.e., bookkeeping and accrual accounting) and how to prepare and interpret the primary financial statements that summarize a firm's economic transactions (i.e., the balance sheet, the income statement, and the statement of cash flows). The course adopts a decision-maker perspective of accounting by emphasizing the relation between accounting data and the underlying economic events that generated them thereby enabling the students to read, understand and analyse financial statements through ratio analysis. The course also explores the areas of financial shenanigans wherein the students will be able to learn how companies use financial statements to disguise economic reality.,",

The course covers three themes drawing high attention from the governments as well as other stakeholders including civil society and businesses. Conventionally the three themes; energy, environment and sustainability; are perceived through the lens of trade-offs. This perspective is changing in recent times. Policymakers, professionals and civil society actors are cooperating to align strategies and actions across themes to overcome societal and individual risks and to gain co-benefits and comparative advantage. In many environmentally proactive entities, \u201csustainability\u201d is a core issue that is increasingly integrated with organizational processes, systems and strategies. Delineation of policies to align energy, environment and sustainability is a highly explored subject drawing interest from researchers and practitioners. The course is divided into four modules which combine distinct yet inter-related concepts around the three central themes. The sessions cover the landscape ranging from global, national to local, spanning technologies, management and concepts from social sciences and ecology.\u00a0,",

In India, ve of the top fifteen companies are in the business of energy exploration, production and/or distribution. Apart from the conventional energy businesses, new avenues have also opened up in fields of alternative energy supply, smart grids and energy services.                              Energy businesses are facing unprecedented challenges. While the demand for energy is on the rise, conventional fossil fuel stocks are uncertain and depleting, there is a global imperative to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases. Since energy businesses often transcend national borders, they are exposed to global geopolitical, financial, and environmental market risks.,",

        "Description": "          Fundamentals of design course provides an introduction in the field of design and its cross-disciplinary applications in industry and society. The intent is to give a foundation in design to students enrolled in any programme at the University by exposing them to the basic design fundamentals - principles, methods, processes and approaches. The course will expose the students to the user-centric approach that design adopts to address local and global challenges. They will learn to recognise that design is exploratory in nature and helps navigate ambiguity. It promotes new ways of looking at problems and coming up with solutions which are human-centered and inclusive.With practical exercises, the course will give an overview of the critical design thinking used for problem identification and opportunity mapping in any given context. Students will gain an understanding of design as a creative problem-solving tool to come up with holistic solutions for products, services, systems and experiences. The course is expected to rouse a student\u2019s interest in design. It will equip them with the necessary grounding to pursue design as a higher education or career pathway. Importantly, it will add a richer and diverse perspective to their understanding of their own field of Major education be it management, technology, sciences, humanities or social sciences.This course is open for students who are admitted to any programme at the University,",

Digital is no longer a grey area. It becomes inevitable that the brand language be effectively transformed from one media to another without changing the brand image. Throughout this course, the focus would be to expose students to ideas, applications, experiences and opportunities that are relevant to today\u2019s times. This course is primarily about creating visual artefacts that communicate effectively, but that does not mean you need to be an artist to succeed. Assessment will focus upon your efforts and your willingness to engage with your classmates to provide feedback and learn from one another. The more time you spend with the exercises in this course, the more skills you will develop as a visual communicator. Take the time to explore each exercise, take risks, and reiterate often. Don\u2019t allow your first attempt at any solution to be your only attempt. Fail early and fail often. Learning what doesn\u2019t work is an essential process in understanding what does work. This course is open for students who are admitted to any programme at the University.    ,",

It focuses on the key principles of music that formulate these genres and connect them to each other, the connection which eventually weaves the complex and diverse fabric called \u2018Indian Music\u2019. The course also tries to understand the relationship of culture and music through the dynamics of above mentioned genres. This course combines Theory and Practice thus students are expected to perform some vocals and also do some research during the course.\u00a0,",

        "Description": "The course invites students to critically examine 1) the ways in which we present ourselves to social audiences and are ascribed identities around gender & sexuality, class, caste, and tribe/ethnicity 2) how differences in social identification become expectations of appropriate behavior and how these codes of conduct are perceived, negotiated, subverted and mobilized in diverse contexts and 3) hierarchies that cohere around difference. The course will largely focus on contemporary forms of social identification but present them as historically and culturally situated, and mediated by global flows. In particular, we will consider the contradictory effects of new technologies and markets for contemporary forms of social identification and inequality, and the utility of difference for accruing cultural capital in a market economy. Course content is drawn from a range of academic fields of inquiry including anthropology, sociology, literature and cultural studies.\u00a0,",

The course will also help students to understand the evolution of Indian politics since 1947 by examining changes in social movements and interest groups and the myriad ways in which their demands are channeled by political parties and the Indian state. Through this course, students will also develop an appreciation for the historical roots of contemporary political developments like: changing party systems, rise of Hindu nationalism, and agrarian crisis in 21st Century among others.\u00a0,",

        "Description": "The city of Ahmedabad has been at the crossroads of major historical currents. A key commercial centre of western India, Ahmedabad was at the vanguard of industrialisation in modern India. Ahmedabad via the coastal port cities such as Surat was a gateway to the sea routes of the Indian Ocean via the Arabian Sea, home to influences from West Asia as well as peninsular South Asia. Although the city functioned as a political and administrative centre, it had a strong tradition of craft goods production, merchant entrepreneurship, and banking and financial services.\u00a0 It maintained thriving trade contacts with\u00a0 neighbouring towns and port cities as well as imperial centres at Delhi and Agra. In 1700 AD, Ahmedabad was, by some estimates, the sixth most populous city in the world[1]. Today, it continues as one of the most populous cities in India, a key node of national politics as well as business and urban development initiatives and emblematic of the opportunities and challenges before contemporary Indian society, wherein modernist development paradigms have been superimposed on traditional social structures.\u00a0The course will help students understand the city as an arena for economic activities (industry, trade and commerce, and informal work), merchant communities, entrepreneurship, city life and culture, and global engagement over the centuries. It will also examine the causes and consequences of conflicts over material and symbolic resources, which have been key to the social organisation of the city. It examines various efforts at urban development charting the city\u2019s built form for the future. Through a combination of lectures, classroom discussions, and projects the course encourages students to analyse these historical and contemporary processes in Ahmedabad in the wider historical context of Gujarat. Through these experiences, students will receive an introduction to disciplinary concepts and theories that will be built upon systematically by later courses in the student\u2019s chosen major.\u2018Ahmedabad as a Gateway to the World\u2019 is a mandatory course for all BA students majoring in History or SPS (Social and Political Sciences), and for all Integrated MBA students.

        "Description": "This course is the first of a set of two courses where students will learn scholastic Sanskrit through exercises drawn from various Sanskrit literary sources, such as well-known subh\u0101\u1e63itas, Pa\u00f1catantra, V\u0101lm\u012bki R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a, etc. In this course, students will be introduced gradually to various aspects of Sanskrit morphology and syntax so as to enable them to read simple Sanskrit sentences and verses. Exercises (sentences, verses and passages) for each class will be drawn from original Sanskrit works (brief description below), and will be chosen so as to exemplify the key grammatical features which need to be explained.            The Pa\u00f1catantra is a famous collection of Sanskrit stories, in verse and prose, dated to around the second/third century CE and is considered a n\u012bti\u015b\u0101stra (a treatise on government or political science). The V\u0101lm\u012bki R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a is one of the two famous Indian epics, a mammoth work comprising nearly 24,000 verses and which is of monumental importance and legacy.Each class will be divided into three segments: a revision of the past lesson(s) (and review of assigned after-class exercises), the scheduled lesson, and in-class exercises taken from Sanskrit literature. There will also be surprise tests to further reinforce the learning of various grammatical features. This course will prepare students to take the second of this set of courses (SAN102), wherein students will study more advanced syntactical aspects of the language. These two courses will prepare students with the adequate training in Sanskrit grammar to begin their study of original Sanskrit works in their second year of Sanskrit study (SAN201 and SAN202). Knowledge of the Devan\u0101gar\u012b script is not a prerequisite for this course. This is a core course for the Minor in Sanskrit Studies.Note: This course introduces students to Sanskrit as a classical language, and therefore, all evaluation during this course (class tests, mid-semester examination and end-semester examination) will be entirely open-book. Students are not expected to learn any tables, etc. by rote.,",

The process of designing and doing research is a mix of various elements including the world view and social location of the researcher (researcher positionality), the selection of what one wants to investigate (research problem/question), and how one goes about doing it (research methods). This introductory and project-based course will familiarize students with the philosophical underpinnings of research, and enable them to identify, compare and contrast different qualitative and quantitative research methods suitable for answering a question, apply their understanding to design a research project in small groups, collect and analyse data, and demonstrate basics of academic writing.,",

Promoters of intelligence and government secrecy \u2013 usually those who are in power \u2013 have emphasized its important role for our society to function orderly, because the ends justify the means. On the other hand, guardians of a civil society \u2013 usually the ruled in a democracy, such as citizens, mass media and human rights activists \u2013 have exclaimed that power has been in abuse. Even those who are apathetic or indifferent among ordinary people with politics, become awakened by the political impact that secrecy has once it is revealed as scandals.\u00a0We have no way of gauging the relevant successful cases of secret statecraft and government secrecy in general since we know very little about the whole cases of national leaders\u2019 covert attempts to engage in government secrecy. As a result, we cannot be even certain whether cases of revelation are typical or atypical, or whether revelations were a result of government secrecy failures to reassure or other factors. Empirical evidence to prove or disprove government secrecy theories, thus, could be more speculative by necessity, but it is possible to test some theories with the limited information that can be gleaned from historical records and in social science manners, such as hypothetical deductive approaches.\u00a0Therefore, through this course on intelligence and government secrecy, undergraduate students will ask themselves what secrecy is in the first place and what are the possible future challenges pertinent we have to face. Furthermore, since intelligence and govern secrecy studies pose many ethical and moral questions \u2013 for example, \u201cIs secrecy itself necessary in intelligence?\u201d \u201cIf so, how much secrecy do we need? And at what cost?\u201d \u2013 this course challenges undergraduate students to face these very fundamental questions. Although these are tough questions to answer, they are worthwhile to look into. Additionally, technologies and intelligence tools change over time, so another question is, what legitimizes various types of intelligence collection activities like the eavesdropping of by? National Security Agency? How far does the government\u2019s responsibility go and should go? These questions will prepare students for actual government jobs which social and political science major students, and any students, are mostly pursuing.  The course on intelligence and government secrecy is an intellectual journey that prepares undergraduate students to real-world politics where their survival skills are required and their innovative thoughts and ideas are needed.,",

Also, students from any undergraduate program who are interested in the evolutionary basis of human mind can opt for this course.            Evolutionary Psychology is the theoretical (as well as the empirical) approach that views the human mind through the lens of biological evolution (by natural selection). This course discusses various psychological processes \u2015 particularly, those concerning survival, reproduction, kinship, and group living \u2015 that resulted as the products of evolutionary adaptation. Though the primary objective of this course is to introduce the evolved psychological processes, the course will also cover various theoretical assumptions as well as the empirical observations of the evolutionary approach to human behaviour. Throughout the course, the relevance and the practical applications of evolutionary psychology (in everyday life) will be discussed. ,",

        "Description": "This course will focus on the fundamentals of drawing while emphasising its role in the act of mark-making as a primal instinct of human beings. While drawing is often seen as a primary tool supporting creative research within art practice, this course will also consider drawing as an independent and intimate approach that offers a keen insight to both the creative process and one\u2019s emotional state. To that end, it is a studio-practice course aided by strong contextual studies that will enable students to develop basic rendering skills, understand drawing as a form of action and gesture that is an affirmation of life. Students will be able to objectively perceive the world we live in, which forms the crux of art-making in any art form \u2013 including printmaking, photography, painting, and digital art.",

More specifically, students interested in theatre, literature, designing and parallel creative fields, would benefit. The course falls at the intersection of theatre and designing. Scenic design would teach scene design specific to theatre. The course has been structured to have a holistic approach to the idea of creation and design. Focus would remain heavy on learning the \u2018process\u2019 that one must go through to create; building a base, a backstory, researching, rejecting and revisiting during the process of ideation.Following is the breakdown of how the course is structured: - Movement and composition in acting - Acting and Space design - Creating images from text - Light design - Set design - Sound and music - 3D mapping as new technology - Design principles in scenography - Types of theatres and theatre architecture \u2028,",

        "Description": "What research methods do social scientists use to understand phenomena such as human experiences, processes, events, relations and networks? What does \u2018fieldwork\u2019 entail, and how do researchers define and construct a field? How do social scientists establish the validity, rigour and verifiability of their research questions and hypothesis, while remaining open to the inherently unstable nature of social relations? This course introduces students to research methods in the social sciences through a combination of reading, discussion and fieldwork practice. Alongside tracing some of the key debates that have arisen in qualitative social science methodology, students will learn about new and evolving modes of virtual qualitative field work such as navigating digital and remote sites of research students and the ethics and power dynamics implicit in conducting qualitative research. Each week students will learn about the practical skills as well as the theoretical aspects of conducting social science research. Through a series of practical writing assignments, in-class workshops and peer projects, students will learn key research skills\u2014 formulating  a research question, identifying an empirical research site, sourcing informants, rapport building, conducting interviews and practicing field note techniques. The teaching of research methods will proceed through a close reading of select texts, each of which highlight the possibilities and limits of particular methods- such as interviews, case studies, participant observation, etc. The last third of the course will be devoted to a short on-campus research project in groups or pairs where students will test the methods and approaches they have studied. At the undergraduate level the course is envisaged as a  stepping stone to help students embarking on their undergraduate thesis projects but has been modified to be suitable for graduate students in the interdisciplinary humanities and social sciences. For graduate students, the course will proceed as a reading course which enables them to start thinking critically about key debates in the social sciences, and the methods best suited to their own topic of study.\u00a0,",

There is no better way to do that than to base a course on real data analysis with the popular programming language R. So, analysis of real data sets available through the textbook would be a key component of teaching and evaluation. Data from various fields in biology will be used as examples and exercises and as aids in learning how to use statistical procedures., ",

Sure, the names of Watson and Crick, and Rosalind Franklin as well as the phrase the \u201cdouble helix\u201d might be recognized by many, even if the details aren\u2019t quite right, but how about names such as Friedrich Miescher, Albrecht Kossel or Oswald Avery to name but a few? An how many people know that DNA was first discovered way back in the nineteenth century as the stuff found in pus cells from discarded surgical bandages? Or that the inability of a fingernail to float in a sugar solution led to the design of an experiment dubbed by one renowned scientist as \"the most beautiful experiment in biology\"? This course surveys the history of the DNA molecule through a close reading of a series of seminal papers representing important nodes in the history and understanding of DNA, juxtaposed with commentaries by other scientists or scholars in the humanities and social sciences who have put these discoveries in various historical, social,\u00a0 cultural and intellectual contexts. ,",

        "Description": "This course is an intensive introduction to scholastic Sanskrit, covering not only aspects of advanced grammar but also - perhaps more importantly - initiating students into the practice of reading Sanskrit texts. This course will enable students to take further PhD level courses which may require the close analysis of scholastic texts in Sanskrit, in case the students become interested in pursuing this direction of research. PhD students often come to the University with varying degrees of prior knowledge of the language and this course will enable the instructor to identify the students' exact level and tailor the course accordingly. In order to do so, the course will proceed by way of reading Sanskrit texts in the original and students will be required to prepare before each session their translations of the text assigned. Depending on the students' ability and grasp of the language, specific grammatical topics will be discussed as needed.During the course, students will be assigned readings from at least two texts - one from a literary work (such as the epics) and the second from any intellectual discipline (\u015b\u0101stra) (such as philosophy, medicine, law, etc.). The texts chosen will also pertain to the specific research interests of the students, thereby serving a dual purpose. Firstly, this will enable them to understand first-hand the grammatical variations in the uses of Sanskrit across textual genres and intellectual disciplines (abstract nouns, compounds, verbal forms, etc.). Additionally, the close reading of such influential texts will enable students to identify the key concerns for the thinkers of the respective Sanskritic tradition, which may often be significantly different from those of the corresponding Anglo-European intellectual tradition. Such an understanding can also help shape the research topics that students may explore during their PhD.As is usually the case with Sanskrit reading courses, the texts chosen will vary from year to year depending on the research interests of the student and the instructor. For Monsoon 2025, we propose to read sections from the following two works: the V\u0101lm\u012bki-R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a (specifically, Chapters 55-57 from the Ara\u1e47yak\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da in light of the three commentaries Bh\u016b\u1e63a\u1e47a, Tilaka and \u015airoma\u1e47i) and \u015a\u0101likan\u0101tha's Prakara\u1e47pa\u00f1cik\u0101 (specifically, the chapter on the nature of perception titled the Pratyak\u1e63apariccheda in light of the commentary Ny\u0101yasiddhi).,",

While the course, taught from a practitioner's perspective, will focus on 21st century developments and prospects, it will be rooted in the evolution of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, and the Maldives since the departure of colonial powers from the Subcontinent, and the ensuing inter-relationships of conflict and conflict resolution. The course will discuss various regional initiatives such as SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation); the BBIN (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal) transport connectivity initiative; regional initiatives in energy, water sharing, and climate crisis mitigation; and trans-regional economic initiatives like BIMSTEC which also includes Myanmar and Thailand. The course will discuss the over-arching presence and influence of China, Myanmar and Afghanistan (a member of SAARC), with which South Asia shares vast borders. These regional neighbours are also active ingredients in South Asian outcomes in a range from security to migration, and, along with core South Asian countries, are increasingly a part of Superpower, or 'Super-Complex,' dynamics. This course will also discuss South Asia by looking beyond an Indian pivot to present the perspectives of other South Asian countries. And, conclusively, the course will discuss how the countries of South Asia can work to evolve a future of shared peace and prosperity.,",

Evolutionary Biology is the study of the changes in life forms over time - changes that have occurred over millions of years as well as those that have occurred over just a few decades. In this course, we will look at the various mechanisms of evolution, how these mechanisms work, and how change is measured. This course will begin by reviewing the evolutionary concepts of selection and speciation, phylogenetics and history of life. We will then learn natural selection and adaptation, evolutionary processes, and genes-genomes-phenotypes. The course will wrap up with a look at the evolution and modern society. At the end of this course, students will have a better understanding of the evolution of life. Also, this course will prepare students for future study and research in macroevolution, microevolution, genetics, behavioral biology, evolutionary medicine, and computational biology.,",

It discusses the economic, social and cultural developments for three millennia beginning from 2600 BCE. The course familiarises the students with some of key events and processes such as the emergence and decline of the Harappa Civilisation, debates surrounding the migration and settlements of the Indo-Aryan speakers, economic transformation of the central Ganga valley, cultural and religious churnings related to Buddhism and Jainism, the Sangam period developments in Peninsular India, and the so-called \"Golden Age\" during the Gupta Empire. These themes will be discussed by focusing on the textual, archaeological, and epigraphical sources.,",

The second phase, includes development of concept deigns, evaluation of alternative designs, and concept design finalization. Various design techniques, e.g. TRIZ, Poka Yoke, FMEA, etc. and materials selection using CES are used to prepare engineering drawings resulting in a complete engineering design including Bill of Materials (BoM). To realize the design, techniques of DFM, DFA, are applied and manufacturing drawings are prepared. After making or buying the components, the assembly is carried out to realize the proof-of-concept. After testing, the products are displayed in an expo. Finally, manuals are prepared, and recyclability aspects are addressed.,",

Beginning with an overview of the global Indian diaspora, the course will then focus on migration caused due to the system of indenture. After the abolition of slavery, Indians were transported under the system of indenture (girmit) to the islands of Fiji, Mauritius and the Commonwealth Caribbean islands of Trinidad, Tobago and Guyana to work on the sugarcane plantations. Displaced from their place of origin, and often referred to as the girmityas, they grappled with the ideas of home and belongingness, often invoking nostalgia and longing for a lost homeland. The course includes different forms of readings that range from research essays and short stories, to interviews with writers, and even poetry rendition. Based on classroom discussions and written assignments, this course will enable the students to critically engage with the history of the lesser known Indian diaspora, that of indenture and servitude.
