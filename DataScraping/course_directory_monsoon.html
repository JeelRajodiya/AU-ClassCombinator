While quantitative methodologies and the need for big data drive research in Management studies, this course demonstrates how far business history is a truly global field, even while studying it from a national framework. To draw in-depth, fine-grained comparisons across different regions of the country, examining strategies of firms, states, and business associations, students stand to gain new perspectives into their own businesses while participating in current debates in adjacent fields such as political economy and global businesses.  This course on the history of Indian Business is multidisciplinary in its nature, where history and business are conjointly examined as important tools for understanding human nature and its past endeavors, throwing light on the present and future in many ways for the young managers/entrepreneurs.  By following a project based learning pedagogy, this course attempts at enabling students to understand history as contemporary, everyday lived experience.  </span><br><br>

Businesses are vying to find newer and better ways to manage their resources in the present dynamic environment. Organisation Development is a handy tool that enables organisations to bring in desirable planned changes. In the wake of the current pandemic, embracing change and shifting to newer paradigms has become a new normal for all organisations. A hybrid organisation seems almost inevitable for some time to come. This makes understanding of OD all the more pivotal and necessary. As organisations struggle with or embarks willingly on the path of change, the knowledge of OD and its process driven approach to managing change will go a long way in shaping the immediate and future concerns and aims of modern day organisations. 																																					 														         This course aims to bring out comprehensively the basic principles of OD theory and practice, its history, the process of organisational diagnosis and how one can use various OD interventions at different unit levels (individual, group, inter-group and organisation) to facilitate the process of planned change in an organisation. This course also allows students to look at people, product and process challenges of organisations from multiple perspectives.

From merely being a medium of economic activity, human resources have emerged as an intrinsic stakeholder in the business. In a world of increasing regulatory requirements, efficient compliance of employment codes is the minimum that organizations must achieve. 

Premier organizations strive to strategize their human resource policies and man-power requirements in a way that not only ensures smooth compliance of employment laws but generates greater benefits for an internal stakeholder. 

This course discusses in detail the Labour Codes applicable in India. It starts by examining the constitutional aspects of labour laws. The course then moves on to discussing the four labour codes prevailing in India. In the concluding part, the course discusses the regulatory framework in different countries and highlights the role of global organizations like the International Labour Organization.</span><br><br>

This course aims to enable participants understand and develop leadership insights and competencies at self, group and organisational levels. At the theoretical level, the course aims to provide conceptual frameworks to understand various aspects of leadership at the said three levels. It would highlight the seminal works of John Maxwell, Kouzes and Posner, Richard Daft, Bill George, James Scouller, Ken Blanchard, Jim Collins and Robert Greenleaf among others.   At the application level, the course aims to provide necessary knowledge and skills required to develop a Leadership repertoire in personal and professional contexts through reflections, experiential learning and classroom discussions.  The course would help participants to gain insights into Authentic Leadership and how one can become an effective leader by knowing one’s self and people around us.
																																					
														        
The course will help students to bring in changes at a personal level through reflections and introspection and will help them understand their own values, skills, goals, leadership purpose, leadership readiness etc.

										<td><br><span> 																 																																 																 																 																In human history, the city has existed both as an idea and a place. Also, cities often develop around very different purposes. For instance, some cities become the space for national and international political activities, and some become the hub for business and trade. Other cities are primarily seen as sites for tourism and leisure. However, apart from these images, a city is also subject to continuous change—such as political, cultural, social and religious—which affect the lifestyle of city-dwellers and the image of a city from time to time. Viewed, thus, in the above perspective, City as Text course broadens the idea of a text as a landscape which includes cultural artifacts, institutions, and street cultures, socio-political and economic discourses. This course is interdisciplinary (provides economic perspective, cultural landscape analysis, political and social analysis, and historical background) and would mainly focus on urban formal and informal spaces such as commercial, residential and public. Learning processes in this course are characterized in three main ways:  •	Firstly, intellectual development – understanding the specific socio-economic, cultural, and political factors that have shaped the city and the integration of theoretical and practical concepts. The urban environment enables a variety of different modes of learning, including guided student discovery and interpretation. •	Secondly, technical development - students have the opportunity to hone observation and analytical skills, and competence in information processing and research, as they are brought into direct first-hand contact with the object of their investigation. And as an arena of encounter and interaction, the urban environment facilitates processes of personal development. •	Finally, with the help of digital humanities pedagogy, students will be able to study the intersection between technology and the human experience using the digital tool. This pedagogy will help students to learn the nuances of computing methods to do humanities research. 																					 														 																					 														 																					 														 																					 																																			 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

														                         – Late Jack Welch, former CEO and chairman of General Electric

It will enable participants to understand how these practices should be designed and implemented to provide a competitive advantage to the organization through its people. Further, the course aims to develop decision-making skills keeping in mind that both the organisation and its people grow together. The course introduces various practices and frameworks in talent acquisition, learning, and development, employee relations, health, and safety, etc. The course places every participant in the shoes of a manager who makes decisions for their people with a motive to drive the organisation forward towards its mission. Each session integrates the concept of "Diversity and Inclusion" since it is a prerequisite for people-related practice and decisions.

										<td><br><span>This course offers an introduction to the study of investments in a portfolio context. In doing so, it exposes students to the breadth of investment alternatives and portfolio construction to meet certain investment objectives. Different individuals or institutions will have differing investment objectives. The course will start with a discussion of the ways in which objectives vary, and the resulting portfolio implications. After a brief review of the various markets and their structures we will turn to one of the cornerstones of modern finance - "Modern Portfolio Theory". This is an emphasis on the importance of constructing optimal portfolios, in which diversification is used to achieve a target objective. It holds that capital should be allocated among the major asset groups in order to arrive at a balance of risk and return that matches the circumstances and objectives of the investor. Only after this allocation does individual security selection come into play.We will then go to a review of asset pricing theory, with a brief stop at equity valuation, and bond mathematics. In doing so, students would be exposed to different methods of valuation namely DCF, Relative Valuation and Economic Value Added in the context of deriving the intrinsic value of a share. This is followed by an overview of equity and bond portfolio management strategies and a review of prevailing portfolio performance measures. The course concludes with the question of performance evaluation - how do we measure success as compared to the original objectives?While a predominant proportion of the course contents fall within the contours of "Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)", the course also acclimatizes students on the trajectory of discourse on market efficiency – EMH to Behavioral Finance to Adaptive Market Hypothesis (AMH).  </span><br><br>

														        Organisations are a combination of interactions, relationship and processes that are played out in various scenarios to make the organisation function efficiently. These interactions are not simple in nature and may lead to varied outcomes. Consequently, making an organization a system that is constantly evolving in terms of people, behaviour and its reaction to the systems. In the contemporary world, variables of data, technology, automation, shared economy, behaviour, people and interactions are the reason for any organisation to sustain and leap. Owing to ambidexterity in organisations and people, we see a drastic shift that organisations are going to work. The pandemic has acted as a catalyst for numerous changes in organisations. Thus, making it more critical and intricate to understand the interaction among people, behaviour and the organisations in which we work. The course will be an introduction to concepts that are going to be a part of students/ Managers organisational life. The students shall be able to test their understanding of the concepts that we introduce by examining Organisational life cycle and its various components. This will involve understanding, reflecting and looking at processes that are part of the organisational life of individuals, members of a team or organisations. We shall focus on the following:•    What is organisation for an individual?•    Based on my life and experiences, how do I look at the idea of organisation.•    As a manger/ Employee/ or entrepreneurs what will be my role in an organisation.The course is designed to introduce students to the ideas of Managing people in organisations. While going through the course, they will be able to understand, reflect, debate around the life of and life in organisations during the changing times. Each topic will be acting as the building blocks of organisations and life within them.

It would equip the students to develop people skills and enable them to deal with issues such as improving productivity, job satisfaction, motivation, learning etc. in organisations.

It emphasizes policy and programmatic responses to the informal economy. The informal (unorganized) economy contributes about 60 percent of GDP and employs about 92 percent of the workforce (including agriculture). Small enterprises and labour are struggling to remain afloat and competitive in the current context of globalization and the pandemic crisis. The course is designed to provide an understanding of the informal economy and its various segments. An exposure to the nature of difficulties faced in doing business by enterprises in the sector would help analyze available policy options.  																																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

An organization with a project culture is one that knows where it is going, is focused on results and has a professional team who knows what is expected of them. Professionals & organizations working or desiring to start a new venture in diverse fields require an understanding and insight of Project Management concepts and methods. Projects are vital and often businesses and various functions start with this management operation. Initial activities within a function also start with projects, for eg. Launching a new product in the market or implementing ERP within the organisation. The products are developed at lab scale, tried at pilot scale and produced at plant scale. To handle all these activities later in their careers, management students have to learn Project Management techniques and through planning and control techniques to execute projects. </span><br><br>

Design is a set of activities and processes to bring about this improvement and beneficial change on their own. Design Thinking is a set of activities and processes to let design happen on its own. It is aimed at making designerly behaviour a very core mindset and bodyset.  Design Thinking in the modern context is recognised as a core business activity which is capable of enhancing all activities around it, making them better and more human and consequently profitable as well. Over the years, it has developed as a very robust and ever-evolving combination of design, science, human behaviour and business principles. At the centre of this is the target user for whom systems are built to understand them, empathise with them define their problems and help them solve these problems through strategically targeted design interventions. Ultimately, all business is about the people who invest in it through one or the other level of consumer behaviour. Design Thinking is aimed at giving business thinkers, a very deeply strategic advantage in the market.  The proposed course is an introduction to Design Thinking which is delivered through a set of 14 sessions, discussions, and structured assignments that help internalise these basic concepts. Several minor assignments and a major project serve as a vehicle for participative action that is central to the understanding of Design Thinking as applied to imaginative business models while understanding four key aspects – context, intent, recipients of the design and the system involved.  																																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

														        Human resource management is the process of gaining a competitive advantage through people. Organizational performance is driven by people, and it depends on certain measures. Human Resource (HR) experts need to be skilled at planning and interpreting organizations' people metrics. This requires a solid understanding of HR analytics, i.e., the systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of data considered to improve decisions about talent and moreover the organization at large. The application of analytics is changing the way HR managers quantify the value that people (i.e., talent) - a company’s biggest asset - have on the organization's ability to succeed in the market or in its mission. For enabling managers to make smart decisions about talent, HR needs to effectually leverage data. When equipped with metrics that are suitably designed and easy to interpret, HR can render managers with analytics to make decisions which will not only improve operations nonetheless also create systemic advantages. Data and sophisticated analysis are brought in the dynamics to effectively handle people-related issues viz., recruiting, hiring and promotion, performance evaluation, leadership, collaboration, job design, and compensation. The curriculum is of an introductory nature to the theory of people analytics. It is not intended to prepare learners to perform complex talent management data analysis. At the conclusion of this course, you will be able to understand that how and when hard data is operated to make soft-skill decisions about hiring and talent development; therefore, you may level yourself as a strategic partner in the company’s talent management decisions. The course will help students in three distinct ways. One, it will provide students with the latest grounding in current evidence on managing people, providing a knowledge base which shall ensure that their future management is led by the best practices. Second, develop the understanding and skills that are necessary to be thoughtful, critical consumers of data on people management, allowing them to make an in-depth analysis as they make people decisions. Third, provide direction and practice in conducting people analytics, preparing students to gather their own data, and making students more skilled analysts. These goals will be pursued through a mixture of case discussion, lecture, and hands-on exploration of a variety of data sets. The course is intended to introduce you to the fact that Organizations flourish when the people who work in them flourish. Analytics can help make both happen.

										<td><br><span>Heritage is a broad concept that draws from various disciplinary discourses including anthropology, architecture, art, culture, development, ecology, environment, forestry, geography, history, natural resources, traditional arts and crafts, urban design and planning, wildlife and so on. However, a general perception of heritage usually refers only to the historic and monumental examples of heritage. Even within the monument-centric discourse, it is widely perceived that the objective of heritage conservation and management is to ‘preserve’ heritage as it is (the cult of the ruins) by using conservation and preservation as a technical process of ensuring the longevity of the ruins. However, it is widely accepted and followed today that the heritage discourse has evolved much broadly to account for change and continuity, the intangibles and more recently calls have been made to view heritage holistically. As opposed to the conservation / preservation paradigm, an interdisciplinary management paradigm is evolving through discourses as well as frameworks of practice at different levels. 
																																					
														        This course provides an overview of both the conventional notions and the evolving concepts. Hence, it gives a critical foundation to heritage understanding and makes students aware of a range of global frameworks that have been influencing current heritage practices. 
This will be a foundational course to begin both for Masters as well as Doctoral students in heritage management. </span><br><br>

														        The area of behaviour is no more restricted solely to experimentation and to decode behaviour for work output. In these contemporary times, managers are challenging the accepted results of a traditional understanding of behaviours. The idea of how behaviour contributes at business, society, and technology levels is changing. The idea of behaviour lab is to deliver behaviour to look at businesses, areas, and domains affected by it. Addictive behaviour, Networks, Irrational decisions, Mapping behaviour online are the newer areas where behaviour’s application has become more relevant. This also means developing skills to understand, analyse and apply behaviour in other areas that are not just restricted to Businesses. Thus, learning behaviour with a more interdisciplinary focus and having skills to understand and analyse them. Consequently, such skills facilitate a person to survive what waits for them in the professional world. Workplace challenges, often fuelled by a keen intuition, can now form the basis of experiments that allow us to understand the processes, decisions, communities and how they work in tandem to achieve or/ and survive changes. Behaviour Lab equips students with tools, methods and interventions aligned with these changes and also help them later in their journey in the business world. Moreover, the course makes them aware of how the behaviour domain is contributing in areas that were untouched earlier.

																‘Environment’ and ‘Sustainable Development’ are the frontier areas providing robust foundation to modern societies. Embedded in these terms are the historical perspectives of civilisations and how these shaped the planet, industrialisation and its impacts, and the emergent challenges of climate change, depleting resources and meeting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The sustainability debate has moved well beyond traditional realms of managing the negative impacts towards a positive global movement in search of innovative solutions to address multiple challenges. This opened up new opportunities in the solutions space – for future researchers, professionals and policymakers.Thus, the global and long-term focus for energy and environment currently relate to three main issues: i) global warming and sustainable energy use, ii) conservation of natural ecosystems  and iii) institutional and technological innovations that make energy, natural environment and development relationship harmonious. In specifics, the evolving paradigms like ‘green growth’, looks for ‘best practices’ that drive energy and environment linkages, e.g. the transformation of power sector to ensure access and affordability, infrastructure transitions which are environmentally benign, harmonious water-energy-climate change nexus, adaptation to climate change impacts and local air quality issues in cities. The course takes an integrated and inclusive view of all these issues.The course materials include research papers, case studies and discussions in conceptual, methodological and policy domains spanning temporal horizons and local to global geographical scales. The course would be based on rigorous theory, readings of texts and articles and case study analysis.

It covers the traditional models essential to understand how the economy functions in the short run, medium run and long run. The short and medium run analysis focuses on the goods market and money market equilibrium along with labour market using IS-LM-PC model. For the long run analysis, students are introduced to the Solow-Swan growth model. Later the course introduces the microfounded approach to macroeconomics and how that can be utilized to explain economic fluctuations and monetary policies. Since much of the current research and policy-making uses macroeconomic models with detailed microfoundations, it is an excellent opportunity for students to study such models.</span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>This introductory course introduces students to the methods of lab and field experiments and the behavioural principles and theories of human decision making. Against the backdrop of Neoclassical economics (specifically Expected Utility Theory), this course will discuss deviations from the standard concepts of individual preferences, beliefs, and decision-making processes. In doing so, we will see that people are loss-averse, present-biased, more social, and often use heuristics in their decision-making. Experimental evidence from education, labour, health, public economics/finance and development economics will elucidate these ideas.  More broadly, this course will provide students with an overview of how researchers and policymakers have leveraged their understanding of behavioural and experimental economics to study and find solutions to fix undesirable or less desirable individual decisions (from a social planner’s perspective). Considering that this is an introductory course, the theory and experiments will be discussed with a greater focus on intuition and a lesser emphasis on the technicalities. The mathematical technicalities, along with the fine details behind the design of an experiment, could be worked upon in a more advanced level course on experimental and/or behavioural economics. 																 																 																																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>An annual report is a powerful and revealing document about a company’s financial standing. To a trained professional it gives a substantial insight into where a company may be headed in the future. However, to an untrained eye the annual report may seem like walls of accounting technicalities provided to fill space between the glossy photos and the upbeat messages from the CEO. In many aspects, reading an annual report could be a daunting task as it is a mixture of factual financial results and public relation information. There is a wide communication gap between the world of compliance and disclosure. It is difficult to interpret and understand the information provided in slick expensively produced annual reports. There can be no better piece of information about a company than annual reports but it is essential to cut through the marketing clutter in annual reports and extract vital information (financial content) that shows true picture of the company.
																																					
														        This enable course will take the students through an intellectual tour of an annual report of the companies. It is designed and meant to develop skills to translate and read between the lines of the published financial statements and Notes to Accounts. It enhances the skill to sense the bigger picture behind the reporting of a company. The part of the course covers tools of financial analysis, including methods of evaluating accounting quality and corporate performance. The course shall address multiple issues pertaining to components of the Annual report like Management Discussion and Analysis (MDA), Directors Report (DR), Financial Highlights and Corporate Governance of the Companies. Through real world examples of listed/unlisted companies and projects, the course focuses on reading the annual reports with the thorough understanding of all the components essential for understanding the working of the company, its peers, economic environment, marketing aspects, growth trajectory, vision and analysis of the management, Auditors’ Remarks and the human resource and ethics as a part of corporate Governance. Students will learn to make better use of annual reports focusing on key issues, raising pertinent questions, and enhancing their understanding of the overall profile of the companies they are assessing.

																In an attempt to acquire a competitive advantage and maximise profit, companies seek ways to enhance customer loyalty.
																																					
														        The most powerful tool to this end is the model of designing experiences. ‘Experience’, differentiated from ‘service’, is a personal, particularly strong connection, based on emotions and imprinted in memory, that the company develops with its customers. 
It is important to note that the model has proved successful even at periods of instability/crisis.
The course presents the principles, methodologies and practical tools of the experience model, and applies it to a wide range of heritage organisations and sectors (such as cultural tourism, fashion/design/ traditional crafts, cultural events, educational programs and digital technology applications) with respect to heritage significance and values.
In this context, the key challenges for heritage organisations are to incorporate the experience model in their:
• strategy: customer experiences at the core of the business model, and not as an incidental byproduct
• management: setting in place and linking management levels, people, and processes for the designing and offering of experiences
• branding and marketing: creating a strong brand centred on customer experience; and communicating the offering of experiences to the customers, through various advertising channels. 
A wide range of heritage organisations, international and Asian and Indian ones, are used as case studies.
The ultimate aim of the course is to help current and potential managers design unique customised experiences, sustaining and expanding their organisations’ customer base and increasing customer loyalty.
The course is open to students of diverse backgrounds and interests. 
The course is offered to both postgraduate and undergraduate students.

										<td><br><span>'Business-model' is a buzz word now in boardrooms, especially when the business encounters problems. The managers agree or disagree if the present business model is working any more or it needs navigation. To put it simply, a business model is both a short- and long-term framework of plans and moral rules within which a business operates. If the business model is strong it creates value and business prospers. Reverse happens when the business model is week. Over a period of time, an existing business calibrates its business model in keeping with the surrounding changes to remain relevant otherwise it may perish. A carefully designed business model has an inherent strength but it may not be long lasting. Hence, calibration is necessary from time to time. A rightly calibrated business model can act as a game changer. Today’s business models were imagined a decade ago and we have to create tomorrow’s business model considering many unknown bets.  Therefore, formal education and intelligent hard work are necessary to create a winning business model. Even though there are some generic and popular business models developed by experts, the owners and managers can bypass the standard ones and create a differentiated business model most suited to their businesses. This course mainly deals with identifying and placing various business drivers in sequence and changing it whenever and wherever necessary in order to make competitive business models. </span><br><br>

Therefore, branding is a function of strategy and psychology that embeds various facets of design in it.This course is designed to cover the fundamentals of branding and packaging to sensitize you to the decision-making process required to create a cohesive brand language. In a world dominated by brands, it is important to understand the key differentiating factor and then build an experience around it. Strategic Packaging design directly contributes to building a brand image by functional or aesthetic elements or by reinforcement of brand image by giving out an experience. This course will offer the tools and techniques required to formulate the right strategy for success.The pedagogy consists of interactive sessions with a healthy mix of fundamental theory, case studies, on the spot, and group assignments for hands-on learning.Your key takeaway from this course will be the ability to make smart decisions for building a successful brand image and a long-term plan for a lasting brand impression.																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

It is all the more critical that we study its various inspects to learn and use it as an inspiration for good design. The whole area of Biomimicry, Bionics, etc, has developed a lot and there is a lot more awareness about this field in current times. Toys are also recognized today as playing an important role in learning, development, building cultural connect and socio-emotional bonds and as part of the entertainment sector.

So, why do so many products and services fail to achieve this ideal? All products, whether digital or otherwise, must deliver a high-quality user experience or risk losing users to competitors.The focus of interaction design is on user-centred design based on the understanding of real users including their experiences, goals, needs, wants and tasks. The goal of interaction design is also to collect and analyse data to make informed interface design decisions which are critical to creating and delivering successful products, services and systems that fulfil the user/customer, technological and business needs. </span><br><br>

It brings the power of computational analysis to problems and possibilities in humanities and related disciplines. This course aims to inform students of the multi-faceted research areas within DH and equip them with knowledge of fundamentals of computational programming so they may confidently pursue quality interdisciplinary research, thereby, facilitating knowledge dissemination across mediums, industries and times. The students are expected to incorporate a 50:50 ratio in their study of theory and implementing solutions hands-on. Students will be guided to prototype solutions that bridge their primary field of study with the Humanities. The course will result in the culmination of a final project answering a research question which is designed in conjunction with the software development life cycle. Students will also engage closely in a project with Navjivan Press to aid them in their digitisation efforts and experience first-hand the entire process of data analysis, OCR, the utility of unicode for our vernacular languages. The tools that will primarily be used are Python, JupyterNotebook, the command line; use of other OpenAccess methods will be encouraged. Students need not have any prior knowledge of these tools to register for this course. The coursework would broadly involve the creation of born-digital works, critical analysis essays, network analyses on large corpus of humanities data, data visualization and presentations. Students would work individually and in groups, following best practices.</span><br><br>

An organization with a project culture is one that knows where it is going, is focused on results and has a professional team who knows what is expected of them. Professionals & organizations working or desiring to start a new venture in diverse fields require an understanding and insight of Project Management concepts and methods. Projects are vital and often businesses and various functions start with this management operation. Initial activities within a function also start with projects, for e.g. Launching a new product in the market or implementing ERP within the organisation. The products are developed at lab scale, tried at pilot scale and produced at plant scale.  To handle all these activities later in their careers, management students have to learn Project Management techniques and through planning and control techniques to execute projects.</span><br><br>

The study of the concepts and techniques of environmental valuation would be important. Topics covered would include those related to development and sustainability: the degree of substitutability between natural resources and produced forms of capital (namely physical and human) and limits to growth implied by it. Since economic growth of developing nations often involves rising pollution, the course would also spend some time on discussing the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC).

• When do markets fail? What happens when markets fail?
• Can markets exist without Government intervention in the real
world?• Economics is largely about Government Policy- Welfare, Tax, Redistribution etc.• The core question prevails- who gets what, and how much?• All economic theories contain political value judgement.This course attempts to explain economic policies in modern democracies, exploring the interface of economics and political science. The course aims to introduce contemporary tools of economic policy making to expose the students to the current literature of formal economic modeling.
This course attempts to find answers of questions like what determines the size and target beneficiaries of public goods, welfare programs, taxation policies, effect of corrupt public officials, politician-industrialist nexus, electoral-cycles on economic policies. 
The course takes a positivist approach of explaining economic policymaking, assuming all agents are rational and behave strategically, focusing on various kinds of incentives and constraints the policy-makers face under different political systems.

										<td><br><span>Health Care Management is a growing industry across the world. By 2020 the value of the Indian health care market reached over $350 billion. With the continued improvement of medical facilitates, the life expectancy of an individual will increase, which in turn will increase the need for health care providers. Furthermore, the need for professionals to manage health care facilities will also grow. Overall, healthcare management involves the administration of hospitals and hospital networks, medical facilities and oversight of health care professionals. To be a vital part of the medical industry, the role of a health care manager does not require direct care to patients. Presently, there is a lack of managerial understanding, in addition to the belief of the holistic nature of quality management to attain an improved standard of patient care. This course will help to address the different challenges of health care management by exploring both the perspective of the care providers, as well as seekers of the treatment</span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>This introductory course introduces students to the methods of lab and field experiments and the behavioural principles and theories of human decision making. Against the backdrop of Neoclassical Economics, this course will discuss deviations from the standard concepts of individual preferences, beliefs, and decision-making processes. In doing so, we will see that people are loss-averse, present-biased, more social, and often use heuristics in their decision-making. Experimental evidence from education, labour, health, public economics/finance and management will elucidate these ideas. Students will also learn to create and implement experiments using the open-source platform, oTree.
																																					
														        
More broadly, this course will provide students with an overview of how researchers and policymakers have leveraged their understanding of behavioural and experimental economics to improve economic, policy and management outcomes. Considering that this is an introductory course, the theory and experiments will be discussed with a greater focus on intuition and a lesser emphasis on the technicalities.

The core focus of strategic management research has been to understand why firms differ and the locus of competitive advantage. To answer these questions researchers over the last 40 years have explored different concepts with the initial focus of research on the external environment to resource-based view and present focus on ecosystems, stakeholders, and institutions.
The course aims to improve participants' ability to understand the evolution of the strategic management field, and learn about various frameworks, concepts, theories, and debates in the strategic management field.
In this class, we explore current research articles and seminal works which represent the development of strategic mangement research. We broadly explore the concept of strategy, the role of external environment, resources and capabilities, the scope of organisation, institutions, cooperative strategy, innovation and technology, and finally the empirical issues in strategic management research

																This doctoral seminar course provides an in-depth look at the major topics of interest in contemporary Organizational Behavior (OB). OB is the study of human behavior in the organizational context. This includes behavior at the individual, group, and organizational levels of analysis. The first half of the course looks at micro-organizational behavior, i.e., the study of how individuals and groups affect and are affected by organizational context. Individual-level behavior in organizations includes aspects like personality, values, emotions, attitudes, motivation, and performance; while group-level behaviors refer to aspects like leadership, conflict and negotiations, team learning, team cognition, team motivation, teamwork, and team performance.The second half is dedicated to organization theory (or the macro aspects of organizational behavior). It is the study of how organizations behave with respect to their management and organizing processes, intra-organizational relations, organization-environment relations, and the role of organizations in society. Organization theory comprises a body of theories, which sometimes compete in offering explanations for social phenomena. It is an attempt to an attempt to understand the social processes that lead to the emergence, behavior, and outcomes of organizations.The course is designed to provide a broad exposure to the field, an understanding of its central concepts, and opportunities to develop ideas to contribute to this literature. These goals will be pursued by examining a blend of theoretical and empirical research - both classic as well as contemporary. Upon successful completion of the course, the students will be enabled to select theories relevant to their specific research focus.

The course adopts a decision-maker perspective of accounting by emphasizing the relation between accounting data and the underlying economic events that generated them thereby enabling the students to read, understand and analyse financial statements through ratio analysis. The course also explores the areas of financial shenanigans wherein the students will be able to learn how companies use financial statements to disguise economic reality.</span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>Organizations are seen as communicative structures where communication constitutes routine job activities. In this sense, organisations are not merely seen as a place where communication happens, but it exists because employees communicate and create the sense in the existing structure. Also, the idea of the workplace has moved beyond the simple "office space" to "living social networks" that combine work, home and play. Moreover, organisations use their website and social media to communicate with internal and external stakeholders. Viewed, thus, in this context, the course looks at the constitutive view of communication and intends to familiarise students with workplace communications as practised in the corporate world. The course is interdisciplinary and involves the combination of concepts (communication, sociology and computer-mediated technology) into one project. </span><br><br>

Human behavior leads to multiple negative outcomes at organizational  units of individuals , teams and groups.The  way people may behave in organisations may not be always beneficial. Dark side behaviors typically lead to negative outcomes. Those who engage in these negative behaviors generally are aware that their actions can cause harm to others, their employer, and/or to them; hence, the instigator usually has intent. It is essential for tomorrow’s managers to understand what are these behaviors how some times they may lead to functional outcomes, sometimes it may lead to nehative outcomes as well. It is essential that we understand these behaviors, as well as control, prevent, mitigate, or ameliorate their occurrences. I.  Aim of the course is to understand what might be source of such behaviors in organizations and  is it possible to mitigate such behaviors in organizational units.   																																					 														        </span><br><br>

People working in organizations get affected not just by who they are, but also but who they are working with and aspects like their teams, leaders, organizational culture, change and communication. The course shifts away from the individual level to the group, and organizational levels of behavior drawing on concepts and practices from the field of Organizational Behavior (OB). This course provides a basic understanding of your own and others’ behavior, particularly in teams. It enhances your ability to communicate and work effectively with others.  Organization requires effective management of people and a clear understanding of human behavior and social processes. Managers need to have a good understanding both of themselves and of those whom they will lead. The prior knowledge of individuals’ perceptions, attitudes, and behavior will enable you to choose appropriate leadership styles and managerial practices to increase organization effectiveness and positive human outcomes.																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>Why are some countries richer and prosperous than others? Why does inflation increase in some economies and decline in others? What is the linkage between economic indicators and financial markets? What is the different between fiscal and monetary policies? The answer to these and several other questions lies in studying macroeconomics. Macroeconomics is an exciting subject which takes students through various theories and policies which help understand the overall economic development of a country. 

The study of macroeconomics has become even more important in recent times. In the last 15 years, world economy has seen multiple crises such as 2008 global financial crisis, 2020 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine War. These crises posed new challenges leading to many different policies from governments and central banks. The world is also facing its biggest challenge in form of climate change. These new challenges have also posed questions to the pedagogy of macroeconomics seeking new solutions. 
Angus Deaton, recipient of Nobel Prize in Economics (2016) echoed his sentiments on macroeconomics which sum up the subject well: “For me, macroeconomics is like quantum mechanics. Though it is not just me. It changes shape all of the time, and I have done economics long enough to see what is true – and what is not true – change places over and over again.”  (Source: https://www.the-fence.com/issues/issue-11/nobel-endeavours)

The course covers three themes drawing high attention from the governments as well as other stakeholders including civil society and businesses. Conventionally the three themes; energy, environment and sustainability; are perceived through the lens of trade-offs. This perspective is changing in recent times. Policymakers, professionals and civil society actors are cooperating to align strategies and actions across themes to overcome societal and individual risks and to gain co-benefits and comparative advantage. In many environmentally proactive entities, “sustainability” is a core issue that is increasingly integrated with organizational processes, systems and strategies. Delineation of policies to align energy, environment and sustainability is a highly explored subject drawing interest from researchers and practitioners. The course is divided into four modules which combine distinct yet inter-related concepts around the three central themes. The sessions cover the landscape ranging from global, national to local, spanning technologies, management and concepts from social sciences and ecology. </span><br><br>

Understanding consumer behaviour needs an interdisciplinary approach – concepts and methods from several disciplines like neuromarketing, cognitive psychology, behavioural economics, anthropology, sociology, and more. Consumers often make irrational choices. Decisions are based on emotions and unconscious motivations – not only on rational logic. Consumer choices are implicit not explicit. Consumers cannot often express their motivations in response to traditional marketing research surveys. This is because consumers either won’t say why they made some choices (as the answers might not sound logical and reasonable) or they can’t say (as choices were made at an unconscious level and they themselves do not know why they choose a brand). The course will draw on the works of several neuroscientists and behavioural economists like Daniel Kahneman, Richard Thaler, and Dan Ariely. We will use behavioural economics experiments (‘Nudge’ as Richard Thaler calls it) to see how subtle interventions influence brand choices. We will explore how ethnography – a method of immersing oneself in consumer lives (used in anthropology and sociology) – can help us get under the skin of the consumer and observe the role of products and brands in consumer life, as lived and not as claimed in surveys. 																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>Visual/Creative communication in the digital age requires familiarisation and literacy that goes way beyond – beyond traditional practices. Digital is no longer a grey area. It becomes inevitable that the brand language be effectively transformed from one media to another without changing the brand image. Throughout this course, the focus would be to expose students to ideas, applications, experiences and opportunities that are relevant to today’s times. This course is primarily about creating visual artefacts that communicate effectively, but that does not mean you need to be an artist to succeed. Assessment will focus upon your efforts and your willingness to engage with your classmates to provide feedback and learn from one another. The more time you spend with the exercises in this course, the more skills you will develop as a visual communicator. Take the time to explore each exercise, take risks, and reiterate often. Don’t allow your first attempt at any solution to be your only attempt. Fail early and fail often. Learning what doesn’t work is an essential process in understanding what does work. This course is open for students who are admitted to any programme at the University.    </span><br><br>

Does the COVID19 shock have a transitory or persistent effect on macroeconomic indicators like economic growth, unemployment, interest rates and inflation? How do institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund forecast growth rates of nations?Such behaviour of economic as well as financial variables is studied in detail in time series econometrics. The above questions are a few examples in this regard. This course goes beyond the traditional use of time series analysis to forecast the time path of a variable. It is extremely relevant to decompose a series into deterministic and stochastic components for making forecasts, interpretation of economic data, drawing causal inferences and the direction of causality. The serial dependence structure demonstrates a difference equation with both deterministic and stochastic components, whose solution(s) yields a time path of a single series or a vector of many interdependent series.This advanced undergraduate course will familiarise students with modelling and forecasting of time series data. It will expose them to the basic techniques of time series econometric analyses and its applications in economics and nance. The course is designed to provide hands-on training in econometric software(s) such as R, which is an open source free software to critically analyse and investigate pertinent empirical questions in the real world.</span><br><br>

The result is cancer. This course will cover the mechanisms of tumor formation, classification of tumors, pathways involved in tumorigenesis & the relationship between ageing & cancer.Abstract: Cancer is a disease thought to be induced by a combination of genetics, lifestyle & environment. Despite billions of dollars spent on cancer research every year we are still far from an universal cure for cancer. However as a result of this research our understanding of cancer has improved tremendously & we are able to treat many tumors quite successfully. This understanding has also led to a better understanding of normal cellular processes of growth & differentiation in many cases. This course will introduce you to basic mechanisms of tumorigenesis, expose you to some success stories in treating cancer & sensitize you to the heterogeneity of the disease we call cancer. 																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

MUS101 tries to address these questions by exploring and interrogating the existing genres of Indian Music like Tribal-Folk, Classical-Art, Popular, Devotional and Fusion Music. It focuses on the key principles of music that formulate these genres and connect them to each other, the connection which eventually weaves the complex and diverse fabric called ‘Indian Music’. The course also tries to understand the relationship of culture and music through the dynamics of above mentioned genres. This course combines Theory and Practice thus students are expected to perform some vocals and also do some writing during the course.&nbsp;</span><br><br>

As a field of study, the study of international relations focuses on the political, military, economic, and cultural interaction of state and non-state actors at the global level. The field therefore encompasses a diverse array of topics, from economic development to military conflict, from the environment to international institutions. In this course, we explore the key concepts, issues, and processes of international relations through the writings of some of the most influential and important scholars in the field. Through our consideration of their work, we develop the general knowledge and analytic tools necessary to understand, evaluate, and respond to a complex array of problems in the contemporary world.																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

The course will largely focus on contemporary forms of social identification but present them as historically and culturally situated, and mediated by global flows. In particular, we will consider the contradictory effects of new technologies and markets for contemporary forms of social identification and inequality, and the utility of difference for accruing cultural capital in a market economy.

										<td><br><span>Introductory biology is a gateway course that is essential for all biology majors and minors. A clear comprehension of the material in this course is essential for the successful completion of other courses in biology. The course covers modern biology at the molecular and cellular level and includes biological macromolecules, the biochemical and biophysical processes in respiration, energetics, metabolism, photosynthesis, cell signaling, and cell reproduction. These fundamental topics in turn lead to the genetic basis of life with classical and modern understanding of inheritance, an understanding of genes, DNA, RNA, and proteins, in sexual reproduction. The initial part of the course concludes with an introduction to biotechnology and genomics with an emphasis on laboratory techniques, genome mapping, and proteomics. The second part of the course applies our understanding of modern biology, including biotechnology, to viruses and single celled organisms such as prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea), protists, fungi, and to seed and seedless plants. No background is assumed other than basic chemistry and biology at the school level. This course can be taken by non-biology students and satisfies the general education requirement (GER).

										<td><br><span>The city of Ahmedabad has been at the crossroads of major historical currents. A key commercial centre of western India, Ahmedabad was at the vanguard of industrialisation in modern India. Ahmedabad via the coastal port cities such as Surat was a gateway to the sea routes of the Indian Ocean via the Arabian Sea, home to influences from West Asia as well as peninsular South Asia. Although the city functioned as a political and administrative centre, it had a strong tradition of craft goods production, merchant entrepreneurship, and banking and financial services.  It maintained thriving trade contacts with  neighbouring towns and port cities as well as imperial centres at Delhi and Agra. In 1700 AD, Ahmedabad was, by some estimates, the sixth most populous city in the world[1]. Today, it continues as one of the most populous cities in India, a key node of national politics as well as business and urban development initiatives and emblematic of the opportunities and challenges before contemporary Indian society, wherein modernist development paradigms have been superimposed on traditional social structures. The course will help students understand the city as an arena for economic activities (industry, trade and commerce, and informal work), merchant communities, entrepreneurship, city life and culture, and global engagement over the centuries. It will also examine the causes and consequences of conflicts over material and symbolic resources, which have been key to the social organisation of the city. It examines various efforts at urban development charting the city’s built form for the future. Through a combination of lectures, classroom discussions, and projects the course encourages students to analyse these historical and contemporary processes in Ahmedabad in the wider historical context of Gujarat. Through these experiences, students will receive an introduction to disciplinary concepts and theories that will be built upon systematically by later courses in the student’s chosen major.‘Ahmedabad as a Gateway to the World’ is a mandatory course for all BA students majoring in History or SPS (Social and Political Sciences), and for all Integrated MBA students.

Students engage with a set of foundational humanities texts that address questions emerging at the interface of philosophy, history, and literary studies. Students read primary sources in translation from a number of literary traditions such as Telugu, Persian, Tamil, Sanskrit, and Kashmiri sources. Alongside these primary sources, students are introduced to major theoretical perspectives from which to read and interpret these sources.  The course introduces students to early arguments about what distinguishes the human and natural sciences; problematizes and studies the human experience as represented in literature, philosophy and history; and concludes by thinking about the future of the humanities both in India and globally. </span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>This course is the first of a set of two courses where students will learn scholastic Sanskrit through exercises drawn from various Sanskrit literary sources, such as well-known subhāṣitas, Pañcatantra, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, etc. In this course, students will be introduced gradually to various aspects of Sanskrit morphology and syntax so as to enable them to read simple Sanskrit sentences and verses. Exercises (sentences, verses and passages) for each class will be drawn from original Sanskrit works (brief description below), and will be chosen so as to exemplify the key grammatical features which need to be explained.  																																					 														         The Pañcatantra is a famous collection of Sanskrit stories, in verse and prose, dated to around the second/third century CE and is considered a nītiśāstra (a treatise on government or political science). The Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa is one of the two famous Indian epics, a mammoth work comprising nearly 24,000 verses and which is of monumental importance and legacy.  Each class will be divided into three segments: a revision of the past lesson(s) (and review of assigned after-class exercises), the scheduled lesson, and in-class exercises taken from Sanskrit literature. There will also be surprise tests to further reinforce the learning of various grammatical features.   This course will prepare students to take the second of this set of courses, wherein students will study more advanced syntactical aspects of the language. These two courses will prepare students with the adequate training in Sanskrit grammar to begin their study of original Sanskrit works. Knowledge of the Devanāgarī script is not a prerequisite for this course.</span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>Family, Community, Nation is a core course in the Social and Political Sciences major and can serve as a Social Science GER for students from other Majors
In this course, we will critically examine entities such as family, caste, class, community, language and nation, and ask how they generate powerful and sometimes conflicting loyalties among individuals. Are such associations natural and primordial, or contingent and historical? Do they have an economic rationale? How do the actions of state, law, and civil society mediate these attachments?  
Over the course of four modules— Family, Religion, Language and Nation— this course we will address specific questions such as: What is the history of the family as a unit? How did ideas such as the father as the head of the family, or the heterosexual couple as its anchors, come to be taken for granted? What is the significance of caste in our lives, and what is its place in the Indian constitution? What is the relationship of religion to the state? Should it be private and contained within families, or spill over into streets and processions? Why have religious minorities, Dalits, and other groups at the ‘margin’ consistently challenged the idea of nationalism?  
This course builds on the understanding of the production of social identities in the introductory courses of the Social and Political Sciences programme and aims to develop a stronger theoretical foundation for analyzing key social categories. In this course, students will engage with a selection of texts focusing on categorizations along the lines of gender, family, caste, religion, language, and nation. Students will learn to critically examine these categories, their inter-connections, and the processes through which they are reproduced in everyday life.

										<td><br><span>This is the first of a set of two courses that will be taken by all students enrolling for a Diploma (30 credits) or Certificate (15 credits) in Critical Thinking and the Liberal Arts.  COM 211 will be open to 2nd and 3rd year students. The materials and assignments for this course will be pitched at a slightly lower level than for COM 311. 																																					 														         Critical thinking skills help us evaluate the information/social world we encounter carefully. This is especially pertinent for our times since we are bombarded with all kinds of information and misinformation, and further, feel obliged to respond immediately but intelligently. From phishing calls that ask for sensitive financial information to the recent government circular that implied that a COVID vaccine would be ready by independence day, the world we inhabit today requires us to be critical. This course teaches how to critique constructively. It will enable learners to develop tools and techniques with which to examine the increasingly complex and at times elusive information that now reaches us every day.   The careful evaluation of information requires that we do not take what is given at obvious face value. Instead, we ask questions of situations, texts, issues, institutions, and people including ourselves. Accordingly, in this course, we will practice asking questions as we 1) read/view/listen to information and 2) express ideas, such that we learn to identify unstated assumptions and beliefs. Since academic writing is based on this premise of careful evaluation of evidence, the course also introduces students to some of the basic mechanics of academic writing, specifically, identification of sources, accurate summarising of arguments including their limitations, and citation.  </span><br><br>

The students will be introduced to the fundamental concepts, principles and theories in social psychology to then review these in light of the changing times that we live in. The course introduces the idea of social psychologies getting refracted in different social, political and cultural contexts as contrasted to a default universal social psychology. After setting the tone, the course discusses the research methods in social psychology critiquing some key studies as required, while also identifying the advances in social cognition through neuroscience research. The key elements of the study are individual cognition, affect and behavior in the implied and/or actual presence of others, interpersonal behavior- principles and theories therein, esp., focusing on pro-social behavior and aggression and group processes, where the key step level changes that happen in human behavior as a consequence of group affiliation. Throughout the course, applications in different contexts, with an interdisciplinary lens, are introduced and examined in detail. </span><br><br>

Students who are taking a minor in philosophy may also use it to meet their philosophy credit requirements.In the course, we will engage in a close reading of one of the most influential philosophical texts of the 20th century, Thomas Kuhn’s The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (SSR), originally published in 1962. Sessions will primarily consist in detailed reading and discussing the revolutionary importance of SSR, especially in our understanding of science. We will also supplement our reading of this book by looking at a selection of important articles which address some of the focal themes, concepts, and arguments of SSR. The course aims thereby to prepare students for advanced research in the humanities, while illustrating the dynamic processes through which classic philosophical texts are taken up and transform our understanding of a subject (in this case science) in philosophy and beyond.
Note: While the focal text and instructor for PHL 301 is subject to change from year to year, the basic structure of the course will remain constant, and a similar session plan will be followed.</span><br><br>

Be it the electronic instruments we use today, be it the development of solar cells as a renewable source of energy, be it the spectroscopy that we need for any biological or chemical discoveries, there is hardly any sphere of activities that does not need quantum mechanics. In this course the students will be exposed to this subject which involves the most dramatic departure from our understanding of the macroscopic world at the microscopic scales. Students will be introduced the probabilistic concepts in studying the microscopic world which involves both new theoretical developments as well as rigorous mathematical concepts from linear algebra, differential equations and many more. In Quantum Mechanics I, to start with, the failure of classical physics in the microscopic world will be discussed in terms of some very important experiments. Subsequently the idea of quantum mechanics will be introduced. Finally few simple quantum mechanical systems will be introduced and related mathematical concepts will be taught.</span><br><br>

																In this survey course, we will explore topics in metaphysics and epistemology in the key texts of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Western philosophy. This period is the era of the emergence of the natural sciences, and several philosophical debates from this time remain influential in contemporary philosophy.
We will concern ourselves with the following questions: What is the ultimate structure of reality? How might we think of the nature, source and limits of knowledge? Can we rationally prove the existence of God? What is the nature of space and time? How does the mind relate to the body? What is the nature of personal identity? Are our actions really free? In addressing these questions, we will learn about a variety of philosophical positions like rationalism, empiricism, idealism, dualism, monism, and materialism.This course is open to all students. It is a core course for students pursuing a Minor in Philosophy.

														        Nowadays, the world becoming flat and interconnected, people and goods move around across borders more than ever before. People even migrate and settle down in a different country. In Japan, the most aging society on the globe, there are many foreign employees working in a variety of fields, from social service to computer and engineering sciences. The number is increasing every year.This is an introductory language course that helps students understand every life in Japan and make students’ life fulfilling for their future by enabling them to build the Japanese language with cultural sensitivities and communication skills for reading, listening, writing, speaking and interacting with people in Japan as well as the people around them such as fellow classmates in the same community and people with different backgrounds and in different situations, such at school, college, work or in their communities and beyond.</span><br><br>

Research is an attempt to understand the world through systematic study—that is, through identification of a problem, question, or hypothesis; selection of methods to investigate the question, collecting data, interpreting data, and reporting findings. The process of designing and doing research is a mix of various elements including the world view and social location of the researcher (researcher positionality), the selection of what one wants to investigate (research problem/question), and how one goes about doing it (research methods). This introductory and project-based course will familiarize students with the philosophical underpinnings of research, and enable them to identify, compare and contrast different qualitative and quantitative research methods suitable for answering a question, apply their understanding to design a research project in small groups, collect and analyse data, and demonstrate basics of academic writing.</span><br><br>

The approach will be comparative (i.e., it will include animals in addition to humans). The main focus will be to convey mechanisms of neuronal function, and their integration.  The course will be modular with some modules assigned for reading and discussion in class, and some assigned for self-study. An introduction to cell biology (BIO 220) is the preferred pre-requisite. In exceptional cases introductory biology (BIO 101) will suffice but will require the consent of the instructor. </span><br><br>

The main focus of the course is on classical Islamic Philosophy from the early ninth century to the mid-seventeenth century. We study falsafah’s developments in this period with special attention to its interactions with two other important intellectual traditions in Islam, kalam (rational theology) and mysticism (especially Sufism). Some of the questions that we address here include: How can one rationally prove the existence of God? Is the nature of God’s knowledge different from our knowledge? What is happiness? What is the relationship between love and happiness? Do we need religion to live a good life? What constitutes our personal identity? Can we attain infallible knowledge? If yes, how is it possible? Is it attained through rational deliberation, mystical apprehension, or revelation? We also study some important contemporary Islamic schools of thought, Traditionalism, Reformism, and Islamic Feminism. In particular, we are interested to see whether the thinkers of these contemporary schools are simply continuing classical Islamic thought. If yes, in what sense are they contemporary? If no, what does make them different from their Muslim predecessors? This course is open to all students.

																This is an advanced course in exploring critical concepts in social theory. Important explanatory concepts such as representation, agency, class, caste, gender, modernity, intersectionality, state, subject-subjectivity, and identity among others will be explored in a historical and analytical dimension, such that students come to understand what is at stake in identifying (or not identifying) something as an instance of one of these concepts. The course will also introduce students to the history of debates surrounding these concepts such that they understand the contestations around their use. The course consists of four modules:
																																					
														        1.     Reading, Representation, Textuality
2.     Culture and Colonialism 
3.     Nation, Nation-State, Citizenship, and Communities

																What is the Global History Lab: Based in Princeton University, the Global History Lab is a platform for learning, skill development, and collaboration in the creation of new narratives across global divides. Using cutting-edge technologies, innovative pedagogical practices, and training in oral history methods, the GHL educates students about the history of globalisation and prepares them to become knowledge producers for a wider world. The program enlists universities and NGOs to engage in a new model of global education through peer-to-peer exchanges. It pushes the study and application of history into new humanitarian frontiers by integrating displaced peoples and refugees into its network.  It promotes human capabilities of understanding by developing narrative voices and listening skills between strangers.  The GHL is committed to the pursuit of the production of knowledge about the global past globally – in a way that is innovative, economical, and reaches across the world’s fractures.
The Global History Lab is an online course about world history from 1300 to the present. It has been a staple of the Princeton History Department curriculum for a quarter-century. A textbook has been written specifically for it; its textbook, Worlds Together, Worlds Apart: A History of Humankind from Origins to the Present (New York: W. W. Norton, 5th edition 2017) was co-authored by Princeton faculty and now serves as one of the leading manuals of world history. The course currently runs on the EdX platform. All one needs to enroll is an email address. A Teaching Fellow for the course has been arranged by Princeton University (Mr Neel Thakkar, a PhD student at Princeton, who has previous experience of Ahmedabad). The course is an opportunity for a small number of Ahmedabad University students (the upper limit is 24) to learn during the Monsoon Semester alongside students from global universities.
GHL Network: 
One of the principles of the course is to have teams of students engage with each other across borders, to learn the history of the world globally. Along the way, they learn about conflict and teamwork and connectedness. To that end, GHL relies on partners. Ahmedabad University is the only university in India to be approved as a partner. The current collaborators include: Fundación del Pino (Madrid, Spain), Panteion University (Athens, Greece), Potsdam University (Potsdam, Germany), Sciences Po (Paris, France), Al Quds University (East Jerusalem, Palestine), American University of Central Asia (Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan), Bard College Berlin (Berlin, Germany), Central European University (Vienna, Austria), European Humanities University (Vilnius, Lithuania), Fulbright University of Vietnam (Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam), Higher School of Economics (St Petersburg, Russia), American University of Nigeria (Wuro Hausa, Nigeria), American University of Iraq Suleimania (Suleimania, Iraq), Modern University of Business and Science (Beirut, Lebanon), Brac University (Daka, Bangladesh), Kiryandongo Settlement (Bweyale, Uganda), Kakuma & Dadaab Refugee Camps (Kenya), Sapienza University (Rome, Italy), University of Nigeria Ibadan (Ibadan, Nigeria), Los Andes University (Bogotá, Colombia), Tuskegee University (Tuskegee, US), Universidad Tres de Febrero (Buenos Aires, Argentina), Princeton University (Princeton USA). 
The Rationale: 
The Working Group on Global History at the School of Arts and Sciences at Ahmedabad University is interested in building an active platform where exchanges, collaborations, and resource development can occur with practitioners of global history from all over the world. And, in this regard, we find the core concerns of GHL – to consider global history as a form of dialogue to enable an inclusive and integrated world, and to engage with innovative pedagogical and research methods to do so – resonate strongly with our principal values.Course Description: This course takes the students on a voyage into the past. Like many of the explorers, they will meet along the way, they will travel across time from when Chinggis Khan’s armies conquered China and Baghdad in the 13th century and the Black Death scoured the Eurasian world a century later right up to the globalization of our day. Do earlier modes of globalization help us to understand our own age?  How can we understand old and new global divides? The dynamics of combinations, differences, and divisions are many: spiritual, economic, environmental, ideological, military, and political. This course aims to understand the big forces that pull the world’s parts together as well as those that drive them apart.  This course is also an experiment in humanitarian higher education. By connecting displaced people in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East with learners worldwide, it promotes a greater understanding of global integration and disintegration. It emphasizes collaboration across divides. Teams of students solve common historical problems and post their work in a shared gallery space. This course is unique not just in its scale and scope. We learn global history globally. This course connects students across 22 locations around the world, where students from various institutions are taking the same course simultaneously and posting and sharing their ideas on the course Gallery site.

																This enabling course will serve as a major elective for the Social and Political Sciences (SPS) major and as a free elective or General Education Requirement (GER) for students from across the university. Secrecy is itself the art and science of our political life, yet little enough is known about government secrecy and intelligence studies among ordinary citizens as well as scholars. Promoters of intelligence and government secrecy – usually those who are in power – have emphasized its important role for our society to function orderly, because the ends justify the means. On the other hand, guardians of a civil society – usually the ruled in a democracy, such as citizens, mass media and human rights activists – have exclaimed that power has been in abuse. Even those who are apathetic or indifferent among ordinary people with politics, become awakened by the political impact that secrecy has once it is revealed as scandals. We have no way of gauging the relevant successful cases of secret statecraft and government secrecy in general since we know very little about the whole cases of national leaders’ covert attempts to engage in government secrecy. As a result, we cannot be even certain whether cases of revelation are typical or atypical, or whether revelations were a result of government secrecy failures to reassure or other factors. Empirical evidence to prove or disprove government secrecy theories, thus, could be more speculative by necessity, but it is possible to test some theories with the limited information that can be gleaned from historical records and in social science manners, such as hypothetical deductive approaches. Therefore, through this course on intelligence and government secrecy, undergraduate students will ask themselves what secrecy is in the first place and what are the possible future challenges pertinent we have to face. Furthermore, since intelligence and govern secrecy studies pose many ethical and moral questions – for example, “Is secrecy itself necessary in intelligence?” “If so, how much secrecy do we need? And at what cost?” – this course challenges undergraduate students to face these very fundamental questions. Although these are tough questions to answer, they are worthwhile to look into. Additionally, technologies and intelligence tools change over time, so another question is, what legitimizes various types of intelligence collection activities like the eavesdropping of by? National Security Agency? How far does the government’s responsibility go and should go? These questions will prepare students for actual government jobs which social and political science major students, and any students, are mostly pursuing.  The course on intelligence and government secrecy is an intellectual journey that prepares undergraduate students to real-world politics where their survival skills are required and their innovative thoughts and ideas are needed.

Psychologists empirically study mind and behaviour while philosophers (of mind) conceptually analyse and develop arguments about the nature of mind/behaviour. However, there is a cross-pollination between Philosophy and Psychology. Often, the insights developed by philosophers guide the empirical work of psychologists, and similarly, the empirical findings of psychologists have implications for philosophical/theoretical accounts of mind/behaviour. In this spirit, this course discusses the broad theoretical and philosophical implications of the findings of Psychology, particularly with respect to the psychological processes of consciousness, thinking, rationality, free will, and social minds. However, it should be clarified that this course is distinct from traditional “Philosophy of Mind” courses which tend to focus on the fundamental nature of the mind; this course focuses on the empirical findings in Psychology and their theoretical (or philosophical) implications. The sample of the theoretical/philosophical implications of the empirical findings of Psychology include: (a) Do limited resource models of attention imply that we do not see everything that we could see? (b) Do we need language to think? (c) Do we possess the processes to acquire accurate knowledge about ourselves? (d) Why aren’t we always rational? and (e) Do we have free will? </span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>A study of India’s arts and cultural traditions requires one to look at India as a continent rather than a country with one people. While there is  tremendous diversity across its various states and regions, there are stark differences amidst similarities in the rituals, customs, song and dance traditions. 

This course is a survey of India’s folk and tribal arts and cultural traditions, with a focus on dance and theatre forms as they relate to everyday customs and rituals, crafts, textiles and agricultural practices, festivals and rite-of-passage celebrations. Exploring regions such as  Gujarat and Rajasthan, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Nagaland, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, and Andhra Pradesh, the course is part lecture, part group discussion and part practical immersion.

This course is offered by Darpana Academy, Ahmedabad, with Mallika Sarabhai and Revanta Sarabhai as co-instructors. Please write to revanta@darpana.com if you have any questions. Aparajita Basu is the course coordinator.

																Theatre has evolved through time as an important tool of expression and communication.  It is not only a source of entertainment but can serve as a catalyst for social reform or development. Theatre also expands our connection to the larger world around us, and our empathy for lives lived differently from our own. A director or an actor thinks from the perspective of the diverse characters they portray, improving tolerance towards others in the society. The audience, in turn, becomes witness to worlds that they might otherwise not encounter or be familiar with. Studies have also shown that students who participate in theatre perform better in academics as it enhances their power to express themselves.This course aims to introduce students to the different forms and functions of theatre, inclusive of the wide range of roles theatre practitioners can take on, such as directing, acting and scriptwriting.  We will also simultaneously discuss how theatre relates to societal concerns, using theatre games to help students to find present day issues that are relevant to them. Importantly, we will work together on producing skits and script writing in peer groups to encourage students to work cohesively in groups, overcome their inhibitions and find the confidence to engage in creative self-expression.This course is at beginner level & doesn’t require prior theatre experience. It is open to all students at the University. It will run for  one session a week (for 3 hours) as in a lab course. It is offered by Kabir Thakore, the Director of the Scrapyard Theatre in Ahmedabad.

To understand the literature of Premchand is to understand the history of the hopes, aspirations, and social consciousness of the Hindi-Urdu speaking society. In this course, an attempt will be made to read Premchand's literature in two layers. The first layer of reading will bring together Premchand's historical context, the period of the Indian national movement, and Gandhi's Hindustani movement. The second layer of readings will connect present-day issues like nationalism, communalism, caste, gender, and class, to Premchand's articulation of those questions. Premchand is equally a representative writer of both Hindi and Urdu languages. Getting acquainted with his literature in light of the Hindi-Urdu composite culture will give students a new perspective on understanding contemporary issues and their historical underpinnings.</span><br><br>

We will then turn to consider some specific applications of these theories, as well as a number of puzzles that all these accounts of well-being must contend with. The overall goal is to help students to reflect with enhanced clarity, care, and rigour about a topic of perennial human interest.

										<td><br><span>Thinking and Reasoning is an elective course for BA Psychology majors and is mainly (but not exclusively) aimed at BA Psychology students. Also, any student who is interested in the psychology of thinking and reasoning (and fulfilled the prerequisite of Introduction to Psychology) can opt for this course. 

																					
														        
The capacities of thinking and reasoning set humans apart from all other living beings. Because of these capacities humans can imagine and make inferences not just about the perceived entities and events but also about the non-existent constructs. This course discusses the nature of the fundamental psychological processes behind human intellectual feats such as conceptual representation, imagination, moral reasoning, religious thinking, rational analysis, scientific thinking, etc.  
However, it should be clarified that this course is distinct from other courses like critical thinking and logical reasoning; Critical thinking and logical reasoning courses are concerned with “how ought one reason well” ―i.e., they have the normative concern― while this course is mainly concerned with “how do humans actually think and reason” ―i.e., it focuses on the descriptive concern― and thus discusses the psychological dynamics of thinking and reasoning along with the cognitive biases and errors that humans exhibit.
Though the primary objective of this course is to introduce the psychological processes involved in thinking and reasoning, the course will also cover various theoretical assumptions as well as the empirical findings pertaining to thinking and reasoning. Although this course mainly has a descriptive concern, the relevance and the practical applications of the theories and findings of the psychology of thinking and reasoning (as well as the remedies for the errors and biases in thinking and reasoning) will be discussed throughout the course.

										<td><br><span>This course will teach students to critically and qualitatively examine “development” as a practice that is used to organize and govern the world.  Drawing on the disciplines of anthropology, sociology, political science, the course will take students through the history and transformation of developmentalist thinking. Students will understand how ideas about what development means have changed over time, and be able to then examine for themselves how the culture and politics, especially of India, has changed accordingly.We will read how development has been researched qualitatively, through ethnographies (long-term case studies) of the targets of development interventions, and use such ground-up perspectives to evaluate the successes and failures of development holistically. The course will examine specific thrust areas of development such as gender equality, tribal upliftment, environmental protection in terms of their achievements and shortcomings. The course is distributed into four modules that will examine (a) anthropological approaches to development and the history of development; (b)critiques of development and its power; (c) local negotiations with development interventions, and (d) new concepts beyond development. The course will thus familiarize students with the theories and concepts that have emerged to voice the various discontents with developmentalist ideas and policies.  For any student planning to enter the development sector, be a benefactor, or simply an interested citizen, this course will give them the tools to engage with the phenomenon through a historical and critical lens.</span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>“Believing is seeing” is the Apple catchphrase to introduce its Pro Display XDR on the website. Only when one scrolls down can they know the technical details and the design that are ultimately there to promise a high-end visual experience. Apple is only one of many examples where visual experiences occupy a central position in understanding the contemporary and how that informs one’s relationship with history and the past. These instances demonstrate that visual experiences are powerful mediators in a modern world where the clinical faculty of human vision assumes one of the central sensory responses. Indeed, seeing shapes what one believes about the world around and the ideologies structuring belief systems.  

Through intensive hands-on analyses of selected themes and specific visual forms, this course will look into how visual arts shape modern South Asian experiences and craft one’s understanding of their contemporary and their past. It will discuss how visual art forms encode social norms and practices and embody myriad ways of seeing. The pedagogy and class discussions will revolve around the following key issues: What are the objects and sites through which unfolding stories of visual forms may be tracked? Why are artistic practices integral to addressing imperial, colonial, and postcolonial experiences? How do art forms forge community identities in the region, and what are their political implications? Do visual arts practices in modern South Asia belong to a fixed geographical and cultural landscape? Or does thinking about them entail thinking about shifting geopolitical and cultural boundaries? 

These concerns will be addressed by closely experiencing specific media and material objects and their layered narratives. Students will have the opportunity of studying images and objects closely in museum and gallery spaces and appreciate their material, texture, colour and scale, which are often lost in digital projections in the classroom. Simultaneously, the course will weave together abstract thinking with historically and anthropologically grounded scholarship to train students not to see visual arts as naïve forms; students will learn to analyse formal structures and social histories and how visual imageries structure one’s historical consciousness.

The class will enable them to adopt a structured approach to working on their thesis by setting concrete deadlines with well-defined tasks for each week. This includes approaching and finalising a faculty advisor in the first month of the course, who will guide them towards relevant literature, approaches and methodology. The course will facilitate them  to reflect on their writing both in terms of its style and content. We will draw on texts that explain the skill-sets needed to enhance the practice of research and writing. The course will also help students develop as a collegial academic, able to engage with the works of their colleagues, provide constructive criticism and judiciously incorporate feedback from others into their work. By the end of the course they will have a proposal of a thesis or capstone project, with first drafts of each component of a thesis or a project, that they will continue to polish over the rest of the academic year.

																In early 1800, French Baron Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Fourier proposed using an infinite series of sinusoidal functions of different frequencies for describing the conduction of heat in a solid body. It was a radical idea that provided one of the most powerful tools of modern mathematics. Today, Fourier analysis is widely used in natural sciences, engineering, and economics. For example, Fourier analysis is used in digital signal processing, communications, digital image processing, quantum physics, optics, mathematical finance, etc. Within mathematics, Fourier techniques are used in fields ranging from number theory to the theory of partial differential equations. 
																																					
														        
A key idea of Fourier analysis is that every signal (in the time domain) has an associated frequency spectrum and the frequency spectrum completely determines the signal. One can go back and forth between the time and the frequency domains. The two representations (the time domain and the frequency domain) of the same object help in providing new perspectives for modeling and solving a variety of problems in natural sciences and engineering. 
The course will cover the fundamentals of the Fourier series and Fourier transforms (including Discrete Fourier transforms and the FFT (Fast Fourier Transform algorithm). The applications of Fourier methods in Signal Processing, Digital Image Processing, the Solution of Differential Equations, etc., will also be discussed.

																In early 1800, French Baron Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Fourier proposed using an infinite series of sinusoidal functions of different frequencies for describing the conduction of heat in a solid body. It was a radical idea that provided one of the most powerful tools of modern mathematics. Today, Fourier analysis is widely used in natural sciences, engineering, and economics. For example, Fourier analysis is used in digital signal processing, communications, digital image processing, quantum physics, optics, mathematical finance, etc. Within mathematics, Fourier techniques are used in fields ranging from number theory to the theory of partial differential equations.A key idea of Fourier analysis is that every signal (in the time domain) has an associated frequency spectrum and the frequency spectrum completely determines the signal. One can go back and forth between the time and the frequency domains. The two representations (the time domain and the frequency domain) of the same object help in providing new perspectives for modeling and solving a variety of problems in natural sciences and engineering. 
The course will cover the fundamentals of the Fourier series and Fourier transforms (including Discrete Fourier transforms and the FFT algorithm). The applications of Fourier methods in Signal Processing, Digital Image Processing, the Solution of Differential Equations, etc., will also be discussed.

																This is a global history core course for History Major.

The course considers the agency of trade and religion in mediating cultural identities in the Indian Ocean world. Trade involves the exchange of goods. Long-distance trade requires merchants to enter into exchange relationships with people from other cultures. Trade contacts facilitate reciprocal understanding by intersecting with myriad other aspects of human life including religious beliefs. Religion is often defined as a frozen set of precepts, rituals, and moral codes of behaviour. Contrary to this, religion in the early modern period (c. 1500 – c. 1800) exhibited an extraordinary dynamism and fluidity as it moved across geographies. By focusing on trade and religion in the Indian Ocean world, the course discusses the changing perceptions of different social groups as they came into closer contact. 

The Indian Ocean has been one of the oldest world regions that facilitated trade and cultural interactions. The exchange of goods, ideas, technologies, microbes, and plants was often mediated by merchants, mercenaries, and monks straddling across the Indian Ocean regions. In the early modern period, the diversity of peoples from Southeast Asia, South Asia, the Islamic heartlands, East Africa and Europe made the Indian Ocean an emerging globalising arena that brought multiple cultures and religions to closely interact. This led to the processes of identity formation, dissemination and adaptation of cultural practices, and contestations and compromises in forging an open, cosmopolitan society. Understanding this substratum of the historical past will enable us to better understand globalisation.

Furthermore, scheduling problems have been investigated andclassified with respect to their computational complexity. During the last
few years, new and interesting scheduling problems have been formulated
in connection with flexible manufacturing. In this exploratory individual project, the student will focus on implementing various algorithms for several scheduling problems. The project will touch upon topics such as Intractability, Heuristics, Approximation Algorithms, and Integer Linear Programming.

										<td><br><span>This Enable course will serve as a major elective for the Social and Political Sciences (SPS) and as a free elective or Social Science GER for students from across the university.This course introduces students to the study of one of the most prevailing and oldest social categories across the world: religion. It specifically uses ethnographies – records, monographs, accounts of people, their culture or society based on extended fieldwork – to engage with religion as a category for analysis. Rather than an overview of multiple religions, the course is interested in exploring questions and ideas around power and practice, and engagements with and beyond the human.
																																					
														        
The course revolves around major themes that illustrate the study of religion: tradition, myth, ritual, priesthood, self and other, rationality, symbols, secularism, and modernity. It will inform students how religion structures society and disciplines selves. The course will challenge preconceived notions of religion and introduce students to critically examine embodied and ensouled systems.
Sessions will be divided into two components: one will focus on theoretical approaches, concepts, and trends; while the other will attend to select ethnographies and orient students towards field approaches. Readings will be a mix of classics, contemporary debates, short films, and ethnographies. Students will be introduced to reading ethnographies, collecting field data, and writing ethnographic notes. 
The course is valuable to students across the disciplines of History, Philosophy, Psychology, and Social and Political Sciences. It will also help students prepare for their Undergraduate thesis.

														        This course is also an introduction to objective observation of the world as we see it - not as we think we see it and rendering that view in artwork. Beginning with basic principles of painting, this course will continue to challenge and build students’ skill as a painter through representational, abstract, and non-representational style of painting. Among other traditional subject matters including still life, landscapes and cityscapes, our exploration may even include renderings of machines and biological specimens. Studio sessions will be majorly spent making paintings, which will touch upon concepts crucial to the creative process, including critical thinking, discipline, and spontaneity.
Students will complete this course with a basic but strong understanding of making paintings, and also develop competency, both visual and technical, involved in painting. The goal of this course is to give students the basic tools and ideas necessary to begin their own personal painting practice along with finding a means for self-expression through the medium of painting.</span><br><br>

While drawing is often seen as a primary tool supporting creative research within art practice, this course will also consider drawing as an independent and intimate approach that offers a keen insight to both the creative process and one’s emotional state. To that end, it is a studio-practice course aided by strong contextual studies that will enable students to develop basic rendering skills, understand drawing as a form of action and gesture that is an affirmation of life. Students will be able to objectively perceive the world we live in, which forms the crux of art-making in any art form – including printmaking, photography, painting, and digital art.

														        Course Instructor: Dhruv KothariThis 3-credit course will be conducted in 3-hour sessions each week.Rhythm, as most musicians acknowledge,  is the very essence of life.  Some would say we are born with it - in the form of the human heart beat.  Rhythm, of course,  forms an integral component of almost all musical traditions, dividing, in its simplest form, musical time into ‘beats’ and composed of features such as rubato, musical motif and metrical variation.   This course will throw light upon the rhythmic aspects of North Indian classical,Cuban,Colombian,Middle Eastern and West African music traditions. In the  process, students will also be exposed to the overall music of these regions. The course is  open to students from all Schools of the University who are new to percussion or musical practice. During the first half of the semester we will have extended discussions/interactions based on active listening and watching films on various musical traditions. Our objective will be to explore the role of rhythm in sound/music broadly and grasp various concepts of rhythm that are specific to particular musical cultures. In the second half, we will work on hands-on learning, and practice playing a range of percussive instruments, working towards a final ‘demonstration’ or performance for the class.

																Ethics, as an area of philosophical inquiry, deals with the question of how we ought to act in any given situation. In this introductory course, we will explore a set of influential contemporary moral theories, and learn how these can be applied to some of the most pressing moral issues of our time. We will address some aspects of the following questions. Is there a criterion for distinguishing between right and wrong? Are morals culturally relative? What is the best human life? What might be the moral bases for accepting or rejecting practices like euthanasia, abortion, affirmative action, and civil disobedience? To what extent are we obligated to assist people in need? How ought we to treat animals? What might an ethical relationship between nations look like? Finally, we will discuss a subset of key ethical issues relating to the fields of engineering, business, neuroscience and psychology, and the natural and social sciences.

																This is an introductory level course to explore some key issues in philosophy, especially in Western philosophy. The course has a “hands-on” (or, better to say, “brain-on”) approach. Students learn the major skills and techniques that philosophers have developed throughout the history of philosophy (e.g., formal reasoning, conceptual analysis, thought experiment, theory comparison, etc.) through studying and examining their application to some key philosophical problems in ethics, epistemology, metaphysics. We also examine application of such methods to social and political problems of our daily life.

This course provides an introduction to the complexities of animal behaviour, and how it is studied. Students will explore the various behaviours animals adopt in order to meet the challenges of their daily lives. We begin with how animals learn and communicate with each other, then move on to discuss how they find food, avoid predators, choose their mates, and rear their offspring. This course is aimed at anyone looking to broaden their understanding of animal behaviour beyond nature documentaries or a typical high school education.

Life, at the molecular level, involves interaction between different biomolecules such as DNA, protein, etc. This course will introduce the key concepts in the context of these biomolecules and present in detail their sequence features and other important characteristics. Algorithms designed to compare the sequence of proteins would also be discussed. Students would have an opportunity to apply various computation methods – including but not limited to dynamic programming, data visualization, database management, and graph theory – to biological data. The course would introduce key bioinformatics concepts such as sequence alignment, comparative genomics, data mining etc. This interdisciplinary course aims at helping students to develop a perspective on the application of computers to biological sciences.  Students should be proficient with basic programming in python.

Evolutionary Biology is the study of the changes in life forms over time - changes that have occurred over millions of years as well as those that have occurred over just a few decades. In this course, we will look at the various mechanisms of evolution, how these mechanisms work, and how change is measured. This course will begin by reviewing the evolutionary concepts of selection and speciation, phylogenetics and history of life. We will then learn natural selection and adaptation, evolutionary processes, and genes-genomes-phenotypes. The course will wrap up with a look at the evolution and modern society. At the end of this course, students will have a better understanding of the evolution of life. Also, this course will prepare students for future study and research in macroevolution, microevolution, genetics, behavioral biology, evolutionary medicine, and computational biology.																																					 																																			 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

PGMs bring together graph theory and probability theory and provide a flexible framework for modelling large collections of random variables with complex interactions.  The course will focus mainly on three aspects: A. The core representation, including Bayesian and Markov networks, and dynamic Bayesian networks; B. Probabilistic inference algorithms, both exact and approximate; and C. Learning methods for both the parameters and the structure of graphical models. Students entering the class should have a pre-existing working knowledge of probability, statistics, and algorithms. This class will set the foundation for machine learning, predictive analytics, reinforcement learning, natural language processing etc. Students can apply PGM in any field of core computer science and engineering to handle multidimensional uncertain problems.     																																					 																																			 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

This is a course to introduce the students to different aspects of control for mobile robots.  How to control them and make them move around safely and effectively. They start from the basis and finally will end up with a physical moving robot. In this path they will be familiarized with Kinematic and Dynamic of mobile robots, different aspects of robot perception, after a review of control theory and systems they will be introduced to hybrid automata and its components. They go through the theory behind localization and navigation which will lead them to motion planning, after which the practical part of the course will begin.  The robot building will bring up such topics as hardware and software used for making a mobile robot and running it. </span><br><br>

This knowledge could help us understand our world better, and in many contexts enable us to make better decisions. While this is the broad and grand objective, the last 20 years has seen steeply decreasing costs to gather, store, and process data, creating an even stronger motivation for the use of empirical approaches to problem solving.

In Differential Equations, the course will introduce students to the concept of  differential equations, how they arise in real life situations and their importance in Mathematical modelling. We will then concentrate on methods of solving first order equations and second order linear equations. Linear Algebra will take the students through to solving a system of linear equations – concept of Null Space, Row space of a matrix, Rank of a matrix. Concept of Vector spaces will be introduced and discussed in detail with emphasis on basis and dimension and linear transforms from one Vector space to another. Projection of a vector onto a vector space and its use in Least Sq    uares Approximations will be discussed. The   eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices will be introduced and their usefulness in diagonalization will be discussed.

										<td><br><span> 																 																 																 																 																 																 																 																 																 																It may be argued that democracy has emerged as the most desirable, if not the most successful, form of government in the contemporary world. Regardless of whether we like a particular democracy or not, arguments about what is the most legitimate and just form of rule point towards democracy. Why is democracy seen as the most just form of rule? How did such a situation come about historically? Is there evidence to show that, all things considered, democracies are indeed the most just form of government known to us?  Are there specific civic virtues that help democracies flourish? Is there a particular way in which agreement, dissent, cooperation, and conversation between different groups and individuals in a democratic society is to be carried out? Would democracy be a necessary component of a just system of government? And would social justice be a necessary component of democratic government?  These are some of the questions that this course will tackle. The entire course is built on two central ideas about democracy: a) how best to safeguard against arbitrary exercise of state power, and b) how best cultivate the virtue of democratic conversation. The course is divided into four taught modules and a fifth project module. Each of the four modules are built around a normative statement, which is supposed to provoke and organise the discussions within that module. The four normative statements are: Module 1: "Democracy is the most just form of government" Module 2: "Rights take precedence over popular will" Module 3:  "Inequality is antithetical to democracy” 																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

										<td><br><span> 																 																 																 																 																 																 																 																 																 																 																 																 																 																Since time immemorial, human activities have significantly impacted the nature of our planet. Issues such as depleting resources, climate extremes, land degradation, food insecurity, unsustainable consumption and unequal access to resources, pollution, ecosystem degradation and extinction of species have posed challenges of sustainability that span spatial and temporal scales. However, in the recent past, efforts related to conservation and sustainability have also increased manifold, paving the way for a slightly hopeful future. On the crossroads of these vectors, multiple questions such as: what are the sustainability challenges facing humanity? How do we measure environmental footprints? How do we assess uncertainties and risks? Who bears the burden of costs and risks? Can we make our consumption behavior sustainable? How do we create, replicate and upscale innovative ideas?

The course will explore ways of understanding the neighborhood in geographic, historical, cultural, governance terms, as well as its biodiversity, lifestyle and health profile, economic and social characteristics, and physical attributes among other aspects. The course begins with defining and conceptualising neighbourhood. Students would visualize the neighborhood using different thematic maps, and the evolution of cultural and social characteristics of the neighborhoods would be investigated. Analysis of demographic features, livelihood profiles, governance structures, and flow of services would enable students to appreciate modern neighbourhoods. Biodiversity would be explored to evaluate the biological richness of the neighbourhood. Health status and lifestyle of the individual in the neighborhood would be surveyed. Students would also get an opportunity to explore the physical nature of the neighbourhood. 																																					 														        The course will anchor hands-on learning activities in the contexts of a few local neighbourhoods. Students, working in groups, will observe and engage in surveying and document data on the above themes. Besides, students will get a broader perspective on demographic, economic and social characteristics from the population census data and health status from the CMIE economic outlook data. Students will then engage in analyzing the data to understand the neighbourhood. The learning from this course would facilitate students to build a vision around the interplay of the environment, behaviour, and development associated with the neighbourhoods.																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

Both highlight the urgency for us to act - as citizens and as scientists. However, how much do we think of water? How much do we know of this resource apart from what we have read in our school textbooks? Is the water crisis real? Are we taking the right decisions today to secure a better future for the coming generations? How can I, as an individual and as a community participate in the process? Also, as the driver for all forms of life on earth, water is an excellent solvent, however, this excellent solvent’s characteristic, when combined with its flow, makes it a potent carrier of pollutants and pathogenic microorganisms that are often harmful to health. So, what makes water safe to consume and use for many other purposes? Is the water in surface and groundwater bodies in the Ahmedabad area safe for all forms of life? Is it potable? This course will turn students into aware citizens of the country by enabling them to ask relevant questions around the subject of water. 																 																 																 																																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>Young people learn most by direct experiences. It is important to give young people access to volunteering opportunities. If these opportunities can be linked to their curriculum, they gain an integrated way of doing this. The value of blending community service and a liberal education can be manifold.

This course gives an opportunity to students to participate and get involved in non-profit/non-governmental organisations across the city. Physical work is stressed as it gives students a chance to step into new situations and contexts.

The Student Volunteer Programme at Ahmedabad University aims to provide the student community an intense, authentic and meaningful experience in giving, voluntary service and building citizenship. Please read more about the programme in the document 'Student Volunteer Programme' on the AURIS portal, under University Resources --> Documents/Policies/Forms.</span><br><br>
