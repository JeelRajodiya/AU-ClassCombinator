# Course Combinator v2.0

I originally built this project for my freshman CSE100 course. Due to its utility, it quickly gained popularity at Ahmedabad University, serving over **1,000 students** to date. With consistent traffic maintained over three years, I decided to rewrite the entire application from scratch using **Vue.js** to ensure better performance and an enhanced user experience

Live demo is available at https://classcombinator.vercel.app

The project is still maintained only because people found it useful. If you like the project, please give it a star on GitHub and share it with your friends!
