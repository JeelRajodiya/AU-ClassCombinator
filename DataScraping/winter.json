Over the years, it is becoming progressively complex due to innovations in financial markets, shareholder activism and influences from politicians and other stakeholders including financial press. Every day M&As are happening in the business world but only a few large ones are making media headlines. The Competition Commission\u2019s intervention or NCLT\u2019s ruling make further additions to the M&A news. M&As are the causes and results of corporate restructuring necessitated by both ups and downs of the national economy. The managements of the merging companies defend their M&A decisions. The employees become uneasy and skeptical about their future. The stock market reacts positively or negatively. While the overt motives behind many mergers are \u2018growth\u2019 through organic or inorganic combinations, the covert purposes can be driven by \u2018managerial hubris\u2019. But the fact remains; most M&As are failing sooner or later as the mysterious M&A chemistry is less understood. The failure rates are more in developing economies, even though successful CEOs strike the deals. Experts are unanimous in expressing that majority of failed mergers are the results of unscientific M&A decisions but it remains an exotic bets; win some lose some.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0,",

An organization with a project culture is one that knows where it is going, is focused on results and has a professional team who knows what is expected of them. Professionals & organizations working or desiring to start a new venture in diverse fields require an understanding and insight of Project Management concepts and methods. Projects are vital and often businesses and various functions start with this management operation. Initial activities within a function also start with projects, for eg. Launching a new product in the market or implementing ERP within the organisation. The products are developed at lab scale, tried at pilot scale and produced at plant scale. To handle all these activities later in their careers, management students have to learn Project Management techniques and through planning and control techniques to execute projects. ,",

The course is delivered in two parts; foundations of ethics and managerial dilemmas in operational areas. The first part introduces foundational concepts and theories of ethics that provide different perspectives to ethical concerns and dilemmas. The second half deals with specific ethical concerns arising in functional areas of management and ways to resolve these conflicts in managerial decision-making.\u00a0,",

This course also considers decision-making and need to appreciate the problems surrounding scarce resource, pricing and make-or-buy decisions. Standard Costing and Variance Analysis should be known for making budgets and taking pricing decisions. The course would focus on exploring mix, yield, planning and operational variances. Students will also study the importance of both financial and non-financial performance measures in management, the difficulties in assessing performance in divisionalised businesses and the problems caused by failing to consider external influences on performance.,",

So, why do so many products and services fail to achieve this ideal? All products, whether digital or otherwise, must deliver a high-quality user experience or risk losing users to competitors.The focus of interaction design is on user-centred design based on the understanding of real users including their experiences, goals, needs, wants and tasks. The goal of interaction design is also to collect and analyse data to make informed interface design decisions which are critical to creating and delivering successful products, services and systems that fulfil the user/customer, technological and business needs. ,",

It brings the power of computational analysis to problems and possibilities in humanities and related disciplines.\u00a0This course aims to inform students of transdisciplinary research being undertaken within the purview of DH to equip them with the ability to hypothesise and 'critically-make' new media projects.The students are expected to incorporate a 50:50 ratio in their study of theory and implementing solutions hands-on. Students will be guided to prototype solutions that bridge their primary field of study with the Humanities. The course will result in the culmination of a final project answering a research question. Students will engage closely in a project that results in the culmination of a DH-platform as part of their evaluation.The tools that will primarily be used are Python, Google Collab, miscellaneous OpenAccess methods for text, network, spatial analyses will be encouraged. Students need not have any prior knowledge of these tools to register for this course. The coursework would broadly involve the creation of a data essay, a piece of alternative or multimodal writing and towards the development of an OpenAccess digital platform to highlight digital scholarship in Indian galleries, libraries, archives and museums (GLAM) for he general public.,",

        "Description": "In today\u2019s world, the discipline of Project Management is a powerful tool that helps organizations navigate their way effectively through times of change and uncertainty. An organization with a project culture is one that knows where it is going, is focused on results and has a professional team who knows what is expected of them. Professionals & organizations working or desiring to start a new venture in diverse fields require an understanding and insight of Project Management concepts and methods. Projects are vital and often businesses and various functions start with this management operation. Initial activities within a function also start with projects, for e.g. Launching a new product in the market or implementing ERP within the organisation. The products are developed at lab scale, tried at pilot scale and produced at plant scale.\u00a0 To handle all these activities later in their careers, management students have to learn Project Management techniques and through planning and control techniques to execute projects.,",

It aims to build upon the important accounting concepts and principles including revenue recognition, inventory, depreciation, and understanding the accounting equation. The course focuses initially on how to record economic events in the accounting records (i.e., bookkeeping and accrual accounting) and how to prepare and interpret the primary financial statements that summarize a firm's economic transactions (i.e., the balance sheet, the income statement, and the statement of cash flows). The course adopts a decision-maker perspective of accounting by emphasizing the relation between accounting data and the underlying economic events that generated them thereby enabling the students to read, understand and analyse financial statements through ratio analysis. The course also explores the areas of financial shenanigans wherein the students will be able to learn how companies use financial statements to disguise economic reality.,",

Digital is no longer a grey area. It becomes inevitable that the brand language be effectively transformed from one media to another without changing the brand image. Throughout this course, the focus would be to expose students to ideas, applications, experiences and opportunities that are relevant to today\u2019s times. This course is primarily about creating visual artefacts that communicate effectively, but that does not mean you need to be an artist to succeed. Assessment will focus upon your efforts and your willingness to engage with your classmates to provide feedback and learn from one another. The more time you spend with the exercises in this course, the more skills you will develop as a visual communicator. Take the time to explore each exercise, take risks, and reiterate often. Don\u2019t allow your first attempt at any solution to be your only attempt. Fail early and fail often. Learning what doesn\u2019t work is an essential process in understanding what does work. This course is open for students who are admitted to any programme at the University.    ,",

We often talk of \u2018industrialised\u2019 and \u2018developed\u2019 countries in the same breath. But what exactly constitutes industrialisation? What effects does it have on the structure of society? How is it related to science, technology and business? Is industrialisation driven from above (by governments) or from below (by entrepreneurs)? These questions are particularly important today as we face climate change and other environmental challenges.Such questions will be explored in this course through the history of industrialisation in several locations including Britain, continental Europe (especially Germany), the USA, Japan and India. A broad time-period will be covered, starting with the Industrial Revolution in eighteenth-century Britain and coming down to the present day. This is in accordance with newer approaches to the study of industrialisation, which look at the phenomenon on a global scale, rather than focusing on a few (Western) countries (Stearns 2012).,",

MUS101 tries to address these questions by exploring and interrogating the existing genres of Indian Music like Tribal-Folk, Classical-Art, Popular, Devotional and Fusion Music. It focuses on the key principles of music that formulate these genres and connect them to each other, the connection which eventually weaves the complex and diverse fabric called \u2018Indian Music\u2019. The course also tries to understand the relationship of culture and music through the dynamics of above mentioned genres. This course combines Theory and Practice thus students are expected to perform some vocals and also do some writing during the course.\u00a0,",

The goal of the course is for students to develop more advanced skills, though at an introductory level. Students continue their study of Sanskrit grammar and are introduced to more complicated aspects such as participles, rarer verbal forms, compounds, etc. Exercises are here too drawn from several well known Sanskrit sources, such as the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata and R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a.Students complete the textbook, Sa\u1e43sk\u1e5bta-Subodhin\u012b (chapters 16 onwards, same textbook as in SAN101) with occasional supplemental materials distributed by the instructor and a review in the first week of earlier chapters. Depending on the speed of the class, the end of the semester may include reading basic Sanskrit texts. Students are graded on reading preparedness, weekly assignments and a final exam.,",

We will read these primary sources in the original (and in the case of Hind Swaraj in translation) to explore the divergent ideas of India that emerged through the writings of the three barristers, wherein categories like caste, nation and people became contested. We will locate these texts \u2013 and the writers \u2013 in the wider context of the British colonialism and the conversations around the emergent nationhood. Along with the primary texts, we will also read a few contemporary scholarship on these texts \u2013 and their authors \u2013 such as Ajay Skaria (2016), Anupama Rao (2009), Aishwary Kumar (2015), Kapila and Devji (2010), Joseph Alter (2000), etc.,",

Research is an attempt to understand the world through systematic study\u2014that is, through identification of a problem, question, or hypothesis; selection of methods to investigate the question, collecting data, interpreting data, and reporting findings. The process of designing and doing research is a mix of various elements including the world view and social location of the researcher (researcher positionality), the selection of what one wants to investigate (research problem/question), and how one goes about doing it (research methods). This introductory and project-based course will familiarize students with the philosophical underpinnings of research, and enable them to identify, compare and contrast different qualitative and quantitative research methods suitable for answering a question, apply their understanding to design a research project in small groups, collect and analyse data, and demonstrate basics of academic writing.,",

The course will explore this question of how phenomenal experience emerges from the physical stimulation of senses by light, sound, pressure and chemicals in the environment. We have specialised systems to process diverse forms of sensory information. The stimulation by light activates the visual system, and sound engages the auditory system, and so on. The course will track the entire process of perception, from the stimulation of the sensory receptors to the emergence of conscious experience. Students will learn the fundamentals of sensory transduction, neural coding of sensory information, and higher-order processes responsible for assimilating and interpreting sensory information. The students will then use this knowledge to read and reflect on research in the field of perception as well as use the conceptual knowledge towards tangible outcomes. The course will draw ideas from psychophysics, neuroscience, artificial intelligence and philosophy on perceiving the world around us.,",

The methods of engaging with humour will include multiple modes of improvisation, sketch comedy, and stand-up comedy, with each strand building upon the skills gained in the previous unit by emphasising questions of performativity and how to write scripts for performance. Simultaneously, the course will introduce  theoretical approaches that define, delineate, and distinguish what makes us laugh, and why. The course will also explore ways in which comedy shapes culture and social discourse and how public discourses are reframed through social constructions of race, gender, class, caste, sexuality, disability etc. as framed in comedy.\u00a0,",

They include drawing, painting, sculpture, photography and printmaking. However, the category of \"studio art\" will be an entry point to think about spaces and sites beyond the studio per se and engage with broader questions of artistic productions spatially, temporally and politically. Indeed, contemporary art has pushed the boundaries of practices and sites of \u201cstudio art\u201d, and this course will foreground this complex interplay between practice and space, in conjunction with social realities. Students will do hands-on projects in each genre that will form an introduction to specific studio art practices, while also learning their pre-modern and modern histories.\u00a0",

This course will introduce the different theories about the origin of life and gradually move deep towards developing holisc understanding of the biology of the cells. The students will learn about the cell membrane structure and the importance of different cellular organelles. The students will also gain current knowledge about the cell cycle and its regulaon and will be imparted the current knowledge about the signal transducon pathways.                              This is a core course in the DBLS\u2019s iMSc program which is aimed at preparing the students for crical understanding of the biology of the cell. This course will enable the students to gain advance understanding about the different cellular processes and will build upon the foundaon of the molecular biology course which they have studied in the earlier semester. Going forward, this course will also lay strong foundaon for the proper understanding of certain advance level courses like developmental biology and omic technologies in the future semesters.,",

This is a course to introduce the students to different aspects of control for mobile robots.  How to control them and make them move around safely and effectively. They start from the basis and finally will end up with a physical moving robot. In this path they will be familiarized with Kinematic and Dynamic of mobile robots, different aspects of robot perception, after a review of control theory and systems they will be introduced to hybrid automata and its components. They go through the theory behind localization and navigation which will lead them to motion planning, after which the practical part of the course will begin.  The robot building will bring up such topics as hardware and software used for making a mobile robot and running it. ,",

Both highlight the urgency for us to act - as citizens and as scientists. However, how much do we think of water? How much do we know of this resource apart from what we have read in our school textbooks? Is the water crisis real? Are we taking the right decisions today to secure a better future for the coming generations? How can I, as an individual and as a community participate in the process? Also, as the driver for all forms of life on earth, water is an excellent solvent, however, this excellent solvent\u2019s characteristic, when combined with its flow, makes it a potent carrier of pollutants and pathogenic microorganisms that are often harmful to health. So, what makes water safe to consume and use for many other purposes? Is the water in surface and groundwater bodies in the Ahmedabad area safe for all forms of life? Is it potable? This course will turn students into aware citizens of the country by enabling them to ask relevant questions around the subject of water.                                        ,",
