        "Description": "In today\u2019s world, the discipline of Project Management is powerful tool that will help          organizations navigate their way effectively through times of change and uncertainty. An organization with a project culture is one that knows where it is going, is focused on results and has a professional team who knows what is expected of them. Professionals & organizations working or desiring to start a new venture in diverse fields require an understanding and insight of Project Management concepts and methods. Projects are vital and often businesses and various functions start with this management operation. Initial activities within a function also start with projects, for eg. Launching a new product in the market or implementing ERP within the organisation. The products are developed at lab scale, tried at pilot scale and produced at plant scale. To handle all these activities later in their careers, management students have to learn Project Management techniques and through planning and control techniques to execute projects. ,",

Design is a set of activities and processes to bring about this improvement and beneficial change on their own. Design Thinking is a set of activities and processes to let design happen on its own. It is aimed at making designerly behaviour a very core mindset and bodyset.Design Thinking in the modern context is recognised as a core business activity which is capable of enhancing all activities around it, making them better and more human and consequently profitable as well. Over the years, it has developed as a very robust and ever-evolving combination of design, science, human behaviour and business principles. At the centre of this is the target user for whom systems are built to understand them, empathise with them define their problems and help them solve these problems through strategically targeted design interventions. Ultimately, all business is about the people who invest in it through one or the other level of consumer behaviour. Design Thinking is aimed at giving business thinkers, a very deeply strategic advantage in the market.The proposed course is an introduction to Design Thinking which is delivered through a set of 14 sessions, discussions, and structured assignments that help internalise these basic concepts. Several minor assignments and a major project serve as a vehicle for participative action that is central to the understanding of Design Thinking as applied to imaginative business models while understanding four key aspects \u2013 context, intent, recipients of the design and the system involved.,",

        "Description": "Intellectual Property Right is an important part of organization strategy for organizations ranging from commercial companies to non-profits like education and research institutions. It is also important for individuals who create any original work, be it in the scientific, literary, or cultural domain. Intellectual property rights are considered monopolistic rights, but the monopoly is a limited one as the IPRs will go in the public domain after a certain stipulated time. The ethical implications of the IPRs will be discussed and deliberated during the course through various case studies where monopolistic presence versus the social benefits are in conflict especially pharmaceutical products and/or utilitarian goods. The course will familiarize students with the popular types of intellectual properties and the legal provisions related to them and the administrative remedies which can be sought for. With the advent of technology, intellectual property protection has become a challenge due to piracy. The course deals with the technological solutions to the sustainable inventions and whether they can be protected through IPRs or not he course also looks into the contemporary issues of Intellectual Property rights in the global context. The course will also provide insight into the competitive and strategic advantages of enterprises by using Intellectual Property Rights .,",

In these contemporary times, managers are challenging the accepted results of a traditional understanding of behaviours. The idea of how behaviour contributes at business, society, and technology levels is changing. The idea of behaviour lab is to deliver behaviour to look at businesses, areas, and domains affected by it. Addictive behaviour, Networks, Irrational decisions, Mapping behaviour online are the newer areas where behaviour\u2019s application has become more relevant. This also means developing skills to understand, analyse and apply behaviour in other areas that are not just restricted to Businesses. Thus, learning behaviour with a more interdisciplinary focus and having skills to understand and analyse them. Consequently, such skills facilitate a person to survive what waits for them in the professional world. Workplace challenges, often fuelled by a keen intuition, can now form the basis of experiments that allow us to understand the processes, decisions, communities and how they work in tandem to achieve or/ and survive changes. Behaviour Lab equips students with tools, methods and interventions aligned with these changes and also help them later in their journey in the business world. Moreover, the course makes them aware of how the behaviour domain is contributing in areas that were untouched earlier.,",

        "Description": "Banking sector is the lifeline of any modern economy. It is one of the important financial pillars of the financial system, which plays a vital role in the success / failure of an economy. The banking sector is dominant in India as it accounts for more than 60 per cent of the assets of the financial sector. Banking had traditionally remained a protected industry in India. A series of reforms were undertaken based on the recommendations of the Narsimham Committee post 1991. A variety of developments have compelled banks to change the ways of doing business.                                This course attempts to provide a glimpse of some relevant areas that need further attention both from the industry and the academic perspective. ,",

While the course contents would remain the same, different evaluation components would apply to MA students. Secondly, some of the sessions would be covered differently for the MA students and involve more readings for a particular topic. This course is intended to understand the various aspects of energy production, energy consumption and use and its relation to climate change. The course will explain what is meant by climate change, global warming, and sustainable development.   The course intends to discuss some of the policy prescriptions for growth and energy use for India and other developing and developed economies as recommended by national and international bodies. This intersects with studying the energy balance of countries and its exports and imports. We also learn the aspect of providing affordable and clean energy access as part of rural electrification measures in India and the developing world. Finally, non-renewable and renewable resource management and topics in energy efficiency are covered. ,",

        "Description": "'Business-model' is a buzz word now in boardrooms, especially when the business encounters problems. The managers agree or disagree if the present business model is working any more or it needs navigation. To put it simply, a business model is both a short- and long-term framework of plans and moral rules within which a business operates. If the business model is strong it creates value and business prospers. Reverse happens when the business model is week. Over a period of time, an existing business calibrates its business model in keeping with the surrounding changes to remain relevant otherwise it may perish. A carefully designed business model has an inherent strength but it may not be long lasting. Hence, calibration is necessary from time to time. A rightly calibrated business model can act as a game changer. Today\u2019s business models were imagined a decade ago and we have to create tomorrow\u2019s business model considering many unknown bets.  Therefore, formal education and intelligent hard work are necessary to create a winning business model. Even though there are some generic and popular business models developed by experts, the owners and managers can bypass the standard ones and create a differentiated business model most suited to their businesses. This course mainly deals with identifying and placing various business drivers in sequence and changing it whenever and wherever necessary in order to make competitive business models.\u00a0,",

        "Description": "Brands exist in the consumers\u2019 minds and yet entice them to act as if it were a relationship of the heart.Brands often look for top-of-mind recall, but branding is an emotional connection that the audience forms with the brand and its message thereby creating a loyal following. It is not what you think and says but what they (the audience) perceive and believe. Therefore, branding is a function of strategy and psychology that embeds various facets of design in it.This course is designed to cover the fundamentals of branding and packaging to sensitize you to the decision-making process required to create a cohesive brand language. In a world dominated by brands, it is important to understand the key differentiating factor and then build an experience around it. Strategic Packaging design directly contributes to building a brand image by functional or aesthetic elements or by reinforcement of brand image by giving out an experience. This course will offer the tools and techniques required to formulate the right strategy for success.The pedagogy consists of interactive sessions with a healthy mix of fundamental theory, case studies, on the spot, and group assignments for hands-on learning.Your key takeaway from this course will be the ability to make smart decisions for building a successful brand image and a long-term plan for a lasting brand impression.,",

There are many examples of good designs which have been inspired by nature. Biomimicry is studying elements from nature: form, colour, function, movement, life cycle, growth, etc. and using it as an inspiration for designing products, spaces, visuals for communication, systems, etc.Today in our modern world and our way of life, we are moving away from our natural connection with nature. It is all the more critical that we study its various inspects to learn and use it as an inspiration for good design. The whole area of Biomimicry, Bionics, etc, has developed a lot and there is a lot more awareness about this field in current times. Toys are also recognized today as playing an important role in learning, development, building cultural connect and socio-emotional bonds and as part of the entertainment sector. Toys are a part of unstructured play and a means to create playful experiences.  In this course, we will study nature with a new perspective and explore possibilities of using it to ideate and design toys or playful elements.,",

So, why do so many products and services fail to achieve this ideal? All products, whether digital or otherwise, must deliver a high-quality user experience or risk losing users to competitors.The focus of interaction design is on user-centred design based on the understanding of real users including their experiences, goals, needs, wants and tasks. The goal of interaction design is also to collect and analyse data to make informed interface design decisions which are critical to creating and delivering successful products, services and systems that fulfil the user/customer, technological and business needs. ,",

        "Description": "Digital Humanities (DH) is the intersection between humanities, technology, design and data analysis. It brings the power of computational analysis to problems and possibilities in humanities and related disciplines.\u00a0This course aims to inform students of transdisciplinary research being undertaken within the purview of DH to equip them with the ability to hypothesise and 'critically-make' new media projects.The students are expected to incorporate a 50:50 ratio in their study of theory and implementing solutions hands-on. Students will be guided to prototype solutions that bridge their primary field of study with the Humanities. The course will result in the culmination of a final project answering a research question. Students will engage closely in a project that results in the culmination of a DH-platform as part of their evaluation.The tools that will primarily be used are Python, Google Collab, miscellaneous OpenAccess methods for text, network, spatial analyses will be encouraged. Students need not have any prior knowledge of these tools to register for this course. The coursework would broadly involve the creation of a data essay, a piece of alternative or multimodal writing and towards the development of an OpenAccess digital platform to highlight digital scholarship in Indian galleries, libraries, archives and museums (GLAM) for he general public.,",

It aims to build upon the important accounting concepts and principles including revenue recognition, inventory, depreciation, and understanding the accounting equation. The course focuses initially on how to record economic events in the accounting records (i.e., bookkeeping and accrual accounting) and how to prepare and interpret the primary financial statements that summarize a firm's economic transactions (i.e., the balance sheet, the income statement, and the statement of cash flows). The course adopts a decision-maker perspective of accounting by emphasizing the relation between accounting data and the underlying economic events that generated them thereby enabling the students to read, understand and analyse financial statements through ratio analysis. The course also explores the areas of financial shenanigans wherein the students will be able to learn how companies use financial statements to disguise economic reality.,",

        "Description": "          Fundamentals of design course provides an introduction in the field of design and its cross-disciplinary applications in industry and society. The intent is to give a foundation in design to students enrolled in any programme at the University by exposing them to the basic design fundamentals - principles, methods, processes and approaches. The course will expose the students to the user-centric approach that design adopts to address local and global challenges. They will learn to recognise that design is exploratory in nature and helps navigate ambiguity. It promotes new ways of looking at problems and coming up with solutions which are human-centered and inclusive.With practical exercises, the course will give an overview of the critical design thinking used for problem identification and opportunity mapping in any given context. Students will gain an understanding of design as a creative problem-solving tool to come up with holistic solutions for products, services, systems and experiences. The course is expected to rouse a student\u2019s interest in design. It will equip them with the necessary grounding to pursue design as a higher education or career pathway. Importantly, it will add a richer and diverse perspective to their understanding of their own field of Major education be it management, technology, sciences, humanities or social sciences.This course is open for students who are admitted to any programme at the University,",

        "Description": "Visual/Creative communication in the digital age requires familiarisation and literacy that goes way beyond \u2013 beyond traditional practices. Digital is no longer a grey area. It becomes inevitable that the brand language be effectively transformed from one media to another without changing the brand image. Throughout this course, the focus would be to expose students to ideas, applications, experiences and opportunities that are relevant to today\u2019s times. This course is primarily about creating visual artefacts that communicate effectively, but that does not mean you need to be an artist to succeed. Assessment will focus upon your efforts and your willingness to engage with your classmates to provide feedback and learn from one another. The more time you spend with the exercises in this course, the more skills you will develop as a visual communicator. Take the time to explore each exercise, take risks, and reiterate often. Don\u2019t allow your first attempt at any solution to be your only attempt. Fail early and fail often. Learning what doesn\u2019t work is an essential process in understanding what does work. This course is open for students who are admitted to any programme at the University.    ,",

The course also tries to understand the relationship of culture and music through the dynamics of above mentioned genres.

        "Description": "The course invites students to critically examine 1) the ways in which we present ourselves to social audiences and are ascribed identities around gender & sexuality, class, caste, and tribe/ethnicity 2) how differences in social identification become expectations of appropriate behavior and how these codes of conduct are perceived, negotiated, subverted and mobilized in diverse contexts and 3) hierarchies that cohere around difference. The course will largely focus on contemporary forms of social identification but present them as historically and culturally situated, and mediated by global flows. In particular, we will consider the contradictory effects of new technologies and markets for contemporary forms of social identification and inequality, and the utility of difference for accruing cultural capital in a market economy. Course content is drawn from a range of academic fields of inquiry including anthropology, sociology, literature and cultural studies.\u00a0,",

The course will also help students to understand the evolution of Indian politics since 1947 by examining changes in social movements and interest groups and the myriad ways in which their demands are channeled by political parties and the Indian state. Through this course, students will also develop an appreciation for the historical roots of contemporary political developments like: changing party systems, rise of Hindu nationalism, and agrarian crisis in 21st Century among others.\u00a0,",

        "Description": "The city of Ahmedabad has been at the crossroads of major historical currents. A key commercial centre of western India, Ahmedabad was at the vanguard of industrialisation in modern India. Ahmedabad via the coastal port cities such as Surat was a gateway to the sea routes of the Indian Ocean via the Arabian Sea, home to influences from West Asia as well as peninsular South Asia. Although the city functioned as a political and administrative centre, it had a strong tradition of craft goods production, merchant entrepreneurship, and banking and financial services.\u00a0 It maintained thriving trade contacts with\u00a0 neighbouring towns and port cities as well as imperial centres at Delhi and Agra. In 1700 AD, Ahmedabad was, by some estimates, the sixth most populous city in the world[1]. Today, it continues as one of the most populous cities in India, a key node of national politics as well as business and urban development initiatives and emblematic of the opportunities and challenges before contemporary Indian society, wherein modernist development paradigms have been superimposed on traditional social structures.\u00a0The course will help students understand the city as an arena for economic activities (industry, trade and commerce, and informal work), merchant communities, entrepreneurship, city life and culture, and global engagement over the centuries. It will also examine the causes and consequences of conflicts over material and symbolic resources, which have been key to the social organisation of the city. It examines various efforts at urban development charting the city\u2019s built form for the future. Through a combination of lectures, classroom discussions, and projects the course encourages students to analyse these historical and contemporary processes in Ahmedabad in the wider historical context of Gujarat. Through these experiences, students will receive an introduction to disciplinary concepts and theories that will be built upon systematically by later courses in the student\u2019s chosen major.\u2018Ahmedabad as a Gateway to the World\u2019 is a mandatory course for all BA students majoring in History or SPS (Social and Political Sciences), and for all Integrated MBA students.

        "Description": "This course is the first of a set of two courses where students will learn scholastic Sanskrit through exercises drawn from various Sanskrit literary sources, such as well-known subh\u0101\u1e63itas, Pa\u00f1catantra, V\u0101lm\u012bki R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a, etc. In this course, students will be introduced gradually to various aspects of Sanskrit morphology and syntax so as to enable them to read simple Sanskrit sentences and verses. Exercises (sentences, verses and passages) for each class will be drawn from original Sanskrit works (brief description below), and will be chosen so as to exemplify the key grammatical features which need to be explained.            The Pa\u00f1catantra is a famous collection of Sanskrit stories, in verse and prose, dated to around the second/third century CE and is considered a n\u012bti\u015b\u0101stra (a treatise on government or political science). The V\u0101lm\u012bki R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a is one of the two famous Indian epics, a mammoth work comprising nearly 24,000 verses and which is of monumental importance and legacy.  Each class will be divided into three segments: a revision of the past lesson(s) (and review of assigned after-class exercises), the scheduled lesson, and in-class exercises taken from Sanskrit literature. There will also be surprise tests to further reinforce the learning of various grammatical features.   This course will prepare students to take the second of this set of courses (SAN102), wherein students will study more advanced syntactical aspects of the language. These two courses will prepare students with the adequate training in Sanskrit grammar to begin their study of original Sanskrit works in their second year of Sanskrit study (SAN201 and SAN202). Knowledge of the Devan\u0101gar\u012b script is not a prerequisite for this course. This is a core course for the Minor in Sanskrit Studies.,",

Research is an attempt to understand the world through systematic study\u2014that is, through identification of a problem, question, or hypothesis; selection of methods to investigate the question, collecting data, interpreting data, and reporting findings. The process of designing and doing research is a mix of various elements including the world view and social location of the researcher (researcher positionality), the selection of what one wants to investigate (research problem/question), and how one goes about doing it (research methods). This introductory and project-based course will familiarize students with the philosophical underpinnings of research, and enable them to identify, compare and contrast different qualitative and quantitative research methods suitable for answering a question, apply their understanding to design a research project in small groups, collect and analyse data, and demonstrate basics of academic writing.,",

Students will understand how ideas about what development means have changed over time, and be able to then examine for themselves how the culture and politics, especially of India, has changed accordingly.We will read how development has been researched qualitatively, through ethnographies (long-term case studies) of the targets of development interventions, and use such ground-up perspectives to evaluate the successes and failures of development holistically. The course will examine specific thrust areas of development such as gender equality, tribal upliftment, environmental protection in terms of their achievements and shortcomings. The course is distributed into four modules that will examine (a) anthropological approaches to development and the history of development; (b)critiques of development and its power; (c) local negotiations with development interventions, and (d) new concepts beyond development. The course will thus familiarize students with the theories and concepts that have emerged to voice the various discontents with developmentalist ideas and policies. \u00a0For any student planning to enter the development sector, be a benefactor, or simply an interested citizen, this course will give them the tools to engage with the phenomenon through a historical and critical lens.,",

To that end, it is a studio-practice course aided by strong contextual studies that will enable students to develop basic rendering skills, understand drawing as a form of action and gesture that is an affirmation of life. Students will be able to objectively perceive the world we live in, which forms the crux of art-making in any art form \u2013 including printmaking, photography, painting, and digital art.",

We will address some aspects of the following questions. Is there a criterion for distinguishing between right and wrong? Are morals culturally relative? What is the best human life? What might be the moral bases for accepting or rejecting practices like euthanasia, abortion, affirmative action, and civil disobedience? To what extent are we obligated to assist people in need? How ought we to treat animals? What might an ethical relationship between nations look like? Finally, we will discuss a subset of key ethical issues relating to the fields of engineering, business, and bioethics.,",

The course will primarily led by University faculty who will take the students through PRACTICE sessions: (a) ideation and production of a multi-medial theatrical performance piece; (b) construction and conceptualisation of a theatrical narrative; (c) a range of multi- medial artistic practices that actively intervenes in the practice of theatre making. The art works created during the course will have the city as their main thematic. LECTURE sessions to (a) help contextualise the diverse artistic practices to which the student will be exposed to (b) help integrate these learnings with the historical context of theatre making practices in general and with the thematic context of the city in particular. (c) help develop a comprehensive understanding of what is meant by the Integrated arts and how to locate it in the Black Box., ",

An effective way to do that is to base a course on computation and real data analysis with widely used statistical programming language R. So, analysis of real data sets would be a key component of teaching and evaluation. Data from various fields in biology will be used as examples and exercises and as aids in learning how to use statistical procedures.,",

        "Description": "History and systems of Psychology is intended to be an advanced course for masters and doctoral students. It discusses the historical, social, and psychological influences involved in psychology's academic and clinical practices. It discusses the cognitive processes involved in theory formation, the role of personality (and individual differences) in the development of psychologists' scientific interests, and social and ideological factors' influences on psychologists' intellectual and academic activities. It also discusses practical applications of the history and psychology of Psychology, such as demarking and avoiding pseudoscientific views and suggestions to improve the validity of scientific findings. By examining the historical, social, and psychological forces that shape scientific inquiry, the student will gain valuable insights into knowledge creation and become a more informed and critical consumer of scientific information in Psychology.,",

With the composition of the Brahmas\u016btras/ Ved\u0101ntas\u016btras (c.400-450 CE), the philosophy contained in the Upani\u1e63ads was systematized. In the eighth century CE, \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya wrote a commentary on some Upani\u1e63ads and the Brahmas\u016btras providing an advaita (non-dualist) interpretation of the Ved\u0101ntic texts.

It discusses the economic, social and cultural developments for three millennia beginning from 2600 BCE. The course familiarises the students with some of key events and processes such as the emergence and decline of the Harappa Civilisation, debates surrounding the migration and settlements of the Indo-Aryan speakers, economic transformation of the central Ganga valley, cultural and religious churnings related to Buddhism and Jainism, the Sangam period developments in Peninsular India, and the so-called \"Golden Age\" during the Gupta Empire. These themes will be discussed by focusing on the textual, archaeological, and epigraphical sources.,",
