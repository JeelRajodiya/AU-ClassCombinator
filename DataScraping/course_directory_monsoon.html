The critical source of   competitive advantage for these corporations is not their physical assets, but their people. It is people, not companies, who innovate, create new products, make decisions, develop and   implement business plans, penetrate new markets, and serve clients and customers. While developing effective business strategy is important to organizational success, the capacity to implement any given business strategy is completely dependent on a corporation’s people. 																																					 														         The Strategic Human Resource Management module provides students with a critical understanding of the theories, principles, historical trends, current issues and practices relevant to human resource management strategy in organisations. This will support the development of subject specific and key  transferable skills necessary for employment in roles which require the effective management of both  human and knowledge capital within the organisation, therefore extending beyond purely human  resource management roles. By exploring the shifting of roles from process manager or administrator to strategic business advisor and partner, students will understand the unique strategic positioning  of contemporary human resource management and the subsequent demands placed on resources   working in this area 																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

Businesses are vying to find newer and better ways to manage their resources in the present dynamic environment. Organisation Development is a handy tool that enables organisations to bring in desirable planned changes. In the wake of the current pandemic, embracing change and shifting to newer paradigms has become a new normal for all organisations. A hybrid organisation seems almost inevitable for some time to come. This makes understanding of OD all the more pivotal and necessary. As organisations struggle with or embarks willingly on the path of change, the knowledge of OD and its process driven approach to managing change will go a long way in shaping the immediate and future concerns and aims of modern day organisations. 																																					 														         This course aims to bring out comprehensively the basic principles of OD theory and practice, its history, the process of organisational diagnosis and how one can use various OD interventions at different unit levels (individual, group, inter-group and organisation) to facilitate the process of planned change in an organisation. This course also allows students to look at people, product and process challenges of organisations from multiple perspectives. The course aims to develop new learning and skills in the areas of observation, problem solving and decision making among the students. The course aims to foster interdisciplinary thinking and experiential learning among the students through reflections, discussions and hands-on-learning opportunities. </span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>In an era of changing business scenarios, human resources have emerged as an inalienable part of the business. From merely being a medium of economic activity, human resources have emerged as an intrinsic stakeholder in the business. In a world of increasing regulatory requirements, efficient compliance of employment codes is the minimum that organizations must achieve. 

Premier organizations strive to strategize their human resource policies and man-power requirements in a way that not only ensures smooth compliance of employment laws but generates greater benefits for an internal stakeholder. 

This course discusses in detail the Labour Codes applicable in India. It starts by examining the constitutional aspects of labour laws. The course then moves on to discussing the four labour codes prevailing in India. In the concluding part, the course discusses the regulatory framework in different countries and highlights the role of global organizations like the International Labour Organization.</span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>This course deals with Leadership. In the present context the idea of Leadership is changing. A leader is no longer a person with authority who can guide a group of people to a defined goal. The course will highlight the understanding of leadership in the context of influence as suggested by John Maxwell. A modern leader is authentic, leads by example, encourages, empowers, and nurtures people around her /him. S/he is empathetic towards needs of others, is humble and emotionally intelligent. This course aims to enable participants understand and develop leadership insights and competencies at self, group and organisational levels. At the theoretical level, the course aims to provide conceptual frameworks to understand various aspects of leadership at the said three levels. It would highlight the seminal works of John Maxwell, Kouzes and Posner, Richard Daft, Bill George, James Scouller, Ken Blanchard, Jim Collins and Robert Greenleaf among others.   At the application level, the course aims to provide necessary knowledge and skills required to develop a Leadership repertoire in personal and professional contexts through reflections, experiential learning and classroom discussions.  The course would help participants to gain insights into Authentic Leadership and how one can become an effective leader by knowing one’s self and people around us.
																																					
														        
The course will help students to bring in changes at a personal level through reflections and introspection and will help them understand their own values, skills, goals, leadership purpose, leadership readiness etc.

										<td><br><span> 																 																																 																 																 																In human history, the city has existed both as an idea and a place. Also, cities often develop around very different purposes. For instance, some cities become the space for national and international political activities, and some become the hub for business and trade. Other cities are primarily seen as sites for tourism and leisure. However, apart from these images, a city is also subject to continuous change—such as political, cultural, social and religious—which affect the lifestyle of city-dwellers and the image of a city from time to time. Viewed, thus, in the above perspective, City as Text course broadens the idea of a text as a landscape which includes cultural artifacts, institutions, and street cultures, socio-political and economic discourses. This course is interdisciplinary (provides economic perspective, cultural landscape analysis, political and social analysis, and historical background) and would mainly focus on urban formal and informal spaces such as commercial, residential and public. Learning processes in this course are characterized in three main ways:  •	Firstly, intellectual development – understanding the specific socio-economic, cultural, and political factors that have shaped the city and the integration of theoretical and practical concepts. The urban environment enables a variety of different modes of learning, including guided student discovery and interpretation. •	Secondly, technical development - students have the opportunity to hone observation and analytical skills, and competence in information processing and research, as they are brought into direct first-hand contact with the object of their investigation. And as an arena of encounter and interaction, the urban environment facilitates processes of personal development. •	Finally, with the help of digital humanities pedagogy, students will be able to study the intersection between technology and the human experience using the digital tool. This pedagogy will help students to learn the nuances of computing methods to do humanities research. 																					 														 																					 														 																					 														 																					 																																			 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>This course offers an introduction to the study of investments in a portfolio context. In doing so, it exposes students to the breadth of investment alternatives and portfolio construction to meet certain investment objectives. Different individuals or institutions will have differing investment objectives. The course will start with a discussion of the ways in which objectives vary, and the resulting portfolio implications. After a brief review of the various markets and their structures we will turn to one of the cornerstones of modern finance - "Modern Portfolio Theory". This is an emphasis on the importance of constructing optimal portfolios, in which diversification is used to achieve a target objective. It holds that capital should be allocated among the major asset groups in order to arrive at a balance of risk and return that matches the circumstances and objectives of the investor. Only after this allocation does individual security selection come into play.We will then go to a review of asset pricing theory, with a brief stop at equity valuation, and bond mathematics. In doing so, students would be exposed to different methods of valuation namely DCF, Relative Valuation and Economic Value Added in the context of deriving the intrinsic value of a share. This is followed by an overview of equity and bond portfolio management strategies and a review of prevailing portfolio performance measures. The course concludes with the question of performance evaluation - how do we measure success as compared to the original objectives?While a predominant proportion of the course contents fall within the contours of "Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)", the course also acclimatizes students on the trajectory of discourse on market efficiency – EMH to Behavioral Finance to Adaptive Market Hypothesis (AMH).  </span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are more than a century old phenomena. Over the years, it is becoming progressively complex due to innovations in financial markets, shareholder activism and influences from politicians and other stakeholders including financial press. Every day M&As are happening in the business world but only a few large ones are making media headlines. The Competition Commission’s intervention or NCLT’s ruling make further additions to the M&A news. M&As are the causes and results of corporate restructuring necessitated by both ups and downs of the national economy. The managements of the merging companies defend their M&A decisions. The employees become uneasy and skeptical about their future. The stock market reacts positively or negatively. While the overt motives behind many mergers are ‘growth’ through organic or inorganic combinations, the covert purposes can be driven by ‘managerial hubris’. But the fact remains; most M&As are failing sooner or later as the mysterious M&A chemistry is less understood. The failure rates are more in developing economies, even though successful CEOs strike the deals. Experts are unanimous in expressing that majority of failed mergers are the results of unscientific M&A decisions but it remains an exotic bets; win some lose some.    </span><br><br>

														        Organisations are a combination of interactions, relationship and processes that are played out in various scenarios to make the organisation function efficiently. These interactions are not simple in nature and may lead to varied outcomes. Consequently, making an organization a system that is constantly evolving in terms of people, behaviour and its reaction to the systems. In the contemporary world, variables of data, technology, automation, shared economy, behaviour, people and interactions are the reason for any organisation to sustain and leap. Owing to ambidexterity in organisations and people, we see a drastic shift that organisations are going to work. The pandemic has acted as a catalyst for numerous changes in organisations. Thus, making it more critical and intricate to understand the interaction among people, behaviour and the organisations in which we work. The course will be an introduction to concepts that are going to be a part of students/ Managers organisational life. The students shall be able to test their understanding of the concepts that we introduce by examining Organisational life cycle and its various components. This will involve understanding, reflecting and looking at processes that are part of the organisational life of individuals, members of a team or organisations. We shall focus on the following:•    What is organisation for an individual?•    Based on my life and experiences, how do I look at the idea of organisation.•    As a manger/ Employee/ or entrepreneurs what will be my role in an organisation.The course is designed to introduce students to the ideas of Managing people in organisations. While going through the course, they will be able to understand, reflect, debate around the life of and life in organisations during the changing times.

Small enterprises and labour are struggling to remain afloat and competitive in the current context of globalization and the pandemic crisis. The course is designed to provide an understanding of the informal economy and its various segments. An exposure to the nature of difficulties faced in doing business by enterprises in the sector would help analyze available policy options. </span><br><br>

Projects are vital and often businesses and various functions start with this management operation. Initial activities within a function also start with projects, for eg. Launching a new product in the market or implementing ERP within the organisation. The products are developed at lab scale, tried at pilot scale and produced at plant scale. To handle all these activities later in their careers, management students have to learn Project Management techniques and through planning and control techniques to execute projects. </span><br><br>

Ultimately, all business is about the people who invest in it through one or the other level of consumer behaviour. Design Thinking is aimed at giving business thinkers, a very deeply strategic advantage in the market.The proposed course is an introduction to Design Thinking which is delivered through a set of 14 sessions, discussions, and structured assignments that help internalise these basic concepts. Several minor assignments and a major project serve as a vehicle for participative action that is central to the understanding of Design Thinking as applied to imaginative business models while understanding four key aspects – context, intent, recipients of the design and the system involved.</span><br><br>

														        Human resource management is the process of gaining a competitive advantage through people. Organizational performance is driven by people, and it depends on certain measures. Human Resource (HR) experts need to be skilled at planning and interpreting organizations' people metrics. This requires a solid understanding of HR analytics, i.e., the systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of data considered to improve decisions about talent and moreover the organization at large. The application of analytics is changing the way HR managers quantify the value that people (i.e., talent) - a company’s biggest asset - have on the organization's ability to succeed in the market or in its mission. For enabling managers to make smart decisions about talent, HR needs to effectually leverage data. When equipped with metrics that are suitably designed and easy to interpret, HR can render managers with analytics to make decisions which will not only improve operations nonetheless also create systemic advantages. Data and sophisticated analysis are brought in the dynamics to effectively handle people-related issues viz., recruiting, hiring and promotion, performance evaluation, leadership, collaboration, job design, and compensation. The curriculum is of an introductory nature to the theory of people analytics. It is not intended to prepare learners to perform complex talent management data analysis. At the conclusion of this course, you will be able to understand that how and when hard data is operated to make soft-skill decisions about hiring and talent development; therefore, you may level yourself as a strategic partner in the company’s talent management decisions. The course will help students in three distinct ways. One, it will provide students with the latest grounding in current evidence on managing people, providing a knowledge base which shall ensure that their future management is led by the best practices. Second, develop the understanding and skills that are necessary to be thoughtful, critical consumers of data on people management, allowing them to make an in-depth analysis as they make people decisions. Third, provide direction and practice in conducting people analytics, preparing students to gather their own data, and making students more skilled analysts. These goals will be pursued through a mixture of case discussion, lecture, and hands-on exploration of a variety of data sets. The course is intended to introduce you to the fact that Organizations flourish when the people who work in them flourish. Analytics can help make both happen.</span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>Heritage is a broad concept that draws from various disciplinary discourses including anthropology, architecture, art, culture, development, ecology, environment, forestry, geography, history, natural resources, traditional arts and crafts, urban design and planning, wildlife and so on. However, a general perception of heritage usually refers only to the historic and monumental examples of heritage. Even within the monument-centric discourse, it is widely perceived that the objective of heritage conservation and management is to ‘preserve’ heritage as it is (the cult of the ruins) by using conservation and preservation as a technical process of ensuring the longevity of the ruins. However, it is widely accepted and followed today that the heritage discourse has evolved much broadly to account for change and continuity, the intangibles and more recently calls have been made to view heritage holistically. As opposed to the conservation / preservation paradigm, an interdisciplinary management paradigm is evolving through discourses as well as frameworks of practice at different levels. 
																																					
														        This course provides an overview of both the conventional notions and the evolving concepts. Hence, it gives a critical foundation to heritage understanding and makes students aware of a range of global frameworks that have been influencing current heritage practices. 
This will be a foundational course to begin both for Masters as well as Doctoral students in heritage management. </span><br><br>

Intellectual property rights are considered monopolistic rights, but the monopoly is a limited one as the IPRs will go in the public domain after a certain stipulated time. The ethical implications of the IPRs will be discussed and deliberated during the course through various case studies where monopolistic presence versus the social benefits are in conflict especially pharmaceutical products and/or utilitarian goods. The course will familiarize students with the popular types of intellectual properties and the legal provisions related to them and the administrative remedies which can be sought for. With the advent of technology, intellectual property protection has become a challenge due to piracy.

														        The area of behaviour is no more restricted solely to experimentation and to decode behaviour for work output. In these contemporary times, managers are challenging the accepted results of a traditional understanding of behaviours. The idea of how behaviour contributes at business, society, and technology levels is changing. The idea of behaviour lab is to deliver behaviour to look at businesses, areas, and domains affected by it. Addictive behaviour, Networks, Irrational decisions, Mapping behaviour online are the newer areas where behaviour’s application has become more relevant. This also means developing skills to understand, analyse and apply behaviour in other areas that are not just restricted to Businesses. Thus, learning behaviour with a more interdisciplinary focus and having skills to understand and analyse them. Consequently, such skills facilitate a person to survive what waits for them in the professional world. Workplace challenges, often fuelled by a keen intuition, can now form the basis of experiments that allow us to understand the processes, decisions, communities and how they work in tandem to achieve or/ and survive changes. Behaviour Lab equips students with tools, methods and interventions aligned with these changes and also help them later in their journey in the business world. Moreover, the course makes them aware of how the behaviour domain is contributing in areas that were untouched earlier.</span><br><br>

It is one of the important financial pillars of the financial system, which plays a vital role in the success / failure of an economy. The banking sector is dominant in India as it accounts for more than 60 per cent of the assets of the financial sector. Banking had traditionally remained a protected industry in India. A series of reforms were undertaken based on the recommendations of the Narsimham Committee post 1991. A variety of developments have compelled banks to change the ways of doing business.  																 																 																																					 														        																					 														        																					 														         This course attempts to provide a glimpse of some relevant areas that need further attention both from the industry and the academic perspective. </span><br><br>

The short and medium run analysis focuses on the goods market and money market equilibrium along with labour market using IS-LM-PC model. For the long run analysis, students are introduced to the Solow-Swan growth model. Later the course introduces the microfounded approach to macroeconomics and how that can be utilized to explain economic fluctuations and monetary policies. Since much of the current research and policy-making uses macroeconomic models with detailed microfoundations, it is an excellent opportunity for students to study such models.</span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>Of late, ‘Business Valuation’ has gained tremendous prominence due to various judicial pronouncements in India and abroad. In India, a new professional discipline on Valuation has been created through 2017-Valuation Rules and by setting up of Registered Valuers Organisations (RVO) for all purpose valuation. By its nature, valuation is not a precise science due to imperfections in the market and varying perceptions. A valuer may have perfect knowledge of the market but the market may not have perfect knowledge of the value. On every occasion there may not be a definitive value conclusion, but every valuation exercise is based on its circumstances and premise. There is nothing called correct valuation; valuation is an opinion and therefore, the principle of caveat applies. Valuation exercise needs methodical & logical approaches, careful application of the basic valuation principles and adherence to standards and practices. Therefore, a valuation professional needs to be better educated in order to make business valuation theories & practices better explained and better defined in the context. This course deals with various methods and techniques (comprising all the three internationally accepted approaches) of valuation to suit various purposes of valuation, following valuation standards, principles and regulations of the country. Emphasis is given on practical application of the concepts. </span><br><br>

Economics was increasingly seen as one-dimensional with one school dominating the thinking behind everything from pedagogy to policy. Economics is hardly a one dimensional subject and has several schools which fight, compete and shape ideas. A strong need was felt that students should undergo courses in history of economic thought which presents economics from a multidimensional and pluralistic perspective.  This course on History of Economic Thought discusses how several thinkers and philosophers shaped economics theories and ideas overtime. The course discusses the origins of our current theories.

										<td><br><span>An annual report is a powerful and revealing document about a company’s financial standing. To a trained professional it gives a substantial insight into where a company may be headed in the future. However, to an untrained eye the annual report may seem like walls of accounting technicalities provided to fill space between the glossy photos and the upbeat messages from the CEO. In many aspects, reading an annual report could be a daunting task as it is a mixture of factual financial results and public relation information. There is a wide communication gap between the world of compliance and disclosure. It is difficult to interpret and understand the information provided in slick expensively produced annual reports. There can be no better piece of information about a company than annual reports but it is essential to cut through the marketing clutter in annual reports and extract vital information (financial content) that shows true picture of the company.
																																					
														        This enable course will take the students through an intellectual tour of an annual report of the companies. It is designed and meant to develop skills to translate and read between the lines of the published financial statements and Notes to Accounts. It enhances the skill to sense the bigger picture behind the reporting of a company. The part of the course covers tools of financial analysis, including methods of evaluating accounting quality and corporate performance. The course shall address multiple issues pertaining to components of the Annual report like Management Discussion and Analysis (MDA), Directors Report (DR), Financial Highlights and Corporate Governance of the Companies. Through real world examples of listed/unlisted companies and projects, the course focuses on reading the annual reports with the thorough understanding of all the components essential for understanding the working of the company, its peers, economic environment, marketing aspects, growth trajectory, vision and analysis of the management, Auditors’ Remarks and the human resource and ethics as a part of corporate Governance. Students will learn to make better use of annual reports focusing on key issues, raising pertinent questions, and enhancing their understanding of the overall profile of the companies they are assessing.

										<td><br><span>'Business-model' is a buzz word now in boardrooms, especially when the business encounters problems. The managers agree or disagree if the present business model is working any more or it needs navigation. To put it simply, a business model is both a short- and long-term framework of plans and moral rules within which a business operates. If the business model is strong it creates value and business prospers. Reverse happens when the business model is week. Over a period of time, an existing business calibrates its business model in keeping with the surrounding changes to remain relevant otherwise it may perish. A carefully designed business model has an inherent strength but it may not be long lasting. Hence, calibration is necessary from time to time. A rightly calibrated business model can act as a game changer. Today’s business models were imagined a decade ago and we have to create tomorrow’s business model considering many unknown bets.  Therefore, formal education and intelligent hard work are necessary to create a winning business model. Even though there are some generic and popular business models developed by experts, the owners and managers can bypass the standard ones and create a differentiated business model most suited to their businesses. This course mainly deals with identifying and placing various business drivers in sequence and changing it whenever and wherever necessary in order to make competitive business models. </span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>Brands exist in the consumers’ minds and yet entice them to act as if it were a relationship of the heart.Brands often look for top-of-mind recall, but branding is an emotional connection that the audience forms with the brand and its message thereby creating a loyal following. It is not what you think and says but what they (the audience) perceive and believe. Therefore, branding is a function of strategy and psychology that embeds various facets of design in it.This course is designed to cover the fundamentals of branding and packaging to sensitize you to the decision-making process required to create a cohesive brand language. In a world dominated by brands, it is important to understand the key differentiating factor and then build an experience around it. Strategic Packaging design directly contributes to building a brand image by functional or aesthetic elements or by reinforcement of brand image by giving out an experience. This course will offer the tools and techniques required to formulate the right strategy for success.The pedagogy consists of interactive sessions with a healthy mix of fundamental theory, case studies, on the spot, and group assignments for hands-on learning.Your key takeaway from this course will be the ability to make smart decisions for building a successful brand image and a long-term plan for a lasting brand impression.</span><br><br>

It is all the more critical that we study its various inspects to learn and use it as an inspiration for good design. The whole area of Biomimicry, Bionics, etc, has developed a lot and there is a lot more awareness about this field in current times. Toys are also recognized today as playing an important role in learning, development, building cultural connect and socio-emotional bonds and as part of the entertainment sector.

All products, whether digital or otherwise, must deliver a high-quality user experience or risk losing users to competitors.The focus of interaction design is on user-centred design based on the understanding of real users including their experiences, goals, needs, wants and tasks. The goal of interaction design is also to collect and analyse data to make informed interface design decisions which are critical to creating and delivering successful products, services and systems that fulfil the user/customer, technological and business needs. </span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>Digital Humanities (DH) is the intersection between humanities, technology, design and data analysis. It brings the power of computational analysis to problems and possibilities in humanities and related disciplines. This course aims to inform students of transdisciplinary research being undertaken within the purview of DH to equip them with the ability to hypothesise and 'critically-make' new media projects.The students are expected to incorporate a 50:50 ratio in their study of theory and implementing solutions hands-on. Students will be guided to prototype solutions that bridge their primary field of study with the Humanities. The course will result in the culmination of a final project answering a research question. Students will engage closely in a project that results in the culmination of a DH-platform as part of their evaluation.The tools that will primarily be used are Python, Google Collab, miscellaneous OpenAccess methods for text, network, spatial analyses will be encouraged. Students need not have any prior knowledge of these tools to register for this course. The coursework would broadly involve the creation of a data essay, a piece of alternative or multimodal writing and towards the development of an OpenAccess digital platform to highlight digital scholarship in Indian galleries, libraries, archives and museums (GLAM) for he general public.</span><br><br>

An organization with a project culture is one that knows where it is going, is focused on results and has a professional team who knows what is expected of them. Professionals & organizations working or desiring to start a new venture in diverse fields require an understanding and insight of Project Management concepts and methods. Projects are vital and often businesses and various functions start with this management operation. Initial activities within a function also start with projects, for e.g. Launching a new product in the market or implementing ERP within the organisation. The products are developed at lab scale, tried at pilot scale and produced at plant scale.  To handle all these activities later in their careers, management students have to learn Project Management techniques and through planning and control techniques to execute projects.</span><br><br>

Two prominent issues would be use of open-access natural resources (where property rights are not well defined) and environmental public good provision. Apart from coming up with instruments to deal with these problems, the course would also discuss about market failures related to pollution. The study of the concepts and techniques of environmental valuation would be important. Topics covered would include those related to development and sustainability: the degree of substitutability between natural resources and produced forms of capital (namely physical and human) and limits to growth implied by it. Since economic growth of developing nations often involves rising pollution, the course would also spend some time on discussing the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC). The course concludes with “greening” the system of national accounts and attempts to include value of environmental services within the national product of countries (including the case for India).

														        Marketing intangible offerings requires a different approach than marketing physical products. By focusing on the benefits, creating a strong brand, leveraging social proof, and using targeted messaging and content marketing,  one can effectively market their intangible offering to potential customers.

Intangible offerings are everywhere and all pervasive. A Consumer comes into contact with them daily.  An intangible service is a service that cannot be physically touched or seen, such as consulting, education, banking, or healthcare. These services are typically performed by professionals or companies, and are often customized to meet the specific needs of individual customers.Many product driven organizations today have a strong service oriented intangible component. It is, therefore, becoming increasingly important to focus on how to best manage and market these. 


This course demonstrates why and how the intangible market offerings require a distinctive approach to marketing strategy for development and execution and how the intangible service aspects need to be paid attention to for a product firm.

										<td><br><span>The course discusses the core concepts of sustainability. Beginning from the scientific definition of sustainability, the course gives exposure to substitution possibilities in human consumption behaviour and production decisions of firms towards more sustainable choices. The course also studies country level data to see if higher per capita incomes are associated with sustainable choices and better waste management. The course dives into what is a circular economy and how it is related to waste management. From generating energy from waste, incineration to recycling and less dependence on virgin materials, the course studies rules and regulations set by the government with regards to waste management and circular economy. 

Having taken any principles level economics course would be advantageous for taking this course. Basic understanding of concepts such as consumer behaviour, production decisions of firms and how are they related to the aggregate economy would be needed for this course.  For any student at the level of MA in Economics or MBA, this course would be useful in that issues of behavioural economics and energy conservation, how the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) varies with waste generation and recovery and per capita incomes, business opportunities out of waste recovery from landfills and recycling waste would be covered. These topics are essential towards sustainable choices, sustainability and building a circular economy.

Although India is a small market for luxury goods currently (projected value of $8.5 billion in 2023), according to this report, it could reach up to $200 billion by 2030. Apple opened two stores in India this year, Louis Vuitton roped in Deepika Padukone as its first-ever Indian house ambassador, Gucci appointed Alia Bhatt as its first global ambassador from India, and Dior held its first-ever fashion show in India. These and other developments show that the Indian luxury market is ready to take off. This has been possible because of a large number of young, educated, and economically well-off Indian consumers who are exposed to global luxury brands and want to enjoy and showcase their success by buying luxury goods.

In this course, Marketing Luxury Brands, the students will learn to analyze and understand the marketing mix applied to managing luxury brands. Students will learn about the sociological and psychological factors that shape the behavior of luxury consumers. They will learn what makes a product a luxury brand, where these brands are sold, and how the messaging is different for luxury brands. This course also has a set of case studies that will help the students learn to analyze real-world marketing scenarios involving luxury brands.

										<td><br><span>Economists study markets, but what are markets? Are markets where buyers and sellers aggregate to transact at an agreed-upon price? If so, how do they know where to find each other, what price to settle at and how to ensure a transaction remains enforced? In other words, how are markets formed? Most markets do not exhibit spot transactions but require long-drawn negotiations between parties. How are these negotiations carried out? Why do firms exist at all? Why are all transactions not between atomistic sellers and buyers? How do cultural norms, pre-held beliefs, and history determine the functioning of markets? Most government policies are not simply taxes and subsidies but creating quasi-regulatory bodies and alterations in decision-making bodies. How do these reforms affect economic outcomes and development? When does a central government relinquish control to sub-federal bodies, and when should it reclaim that control? 
These conceptually important questions are the subject of Institutional Economics, which studies “the rules, regulations, laws and norms that establish the basis for production, exchange and distribution” (Davis and North, 1971) or, in other words, determine how markets are formed. The institutional perspective considers the role of costly information, asset specificity, and property rights in market activities or allocation of scarce resources. The outcomes of this approach determine why firms exist at all, what kind of contracts exist between different firms, when firms merge or split and what role the state should perform in the functioning of markets. Institutional Economics also considers how culture of a society determines its economic activity—an area which standard textbooks neglect.

It aims to build upon the important accounting concepts and principles including revenue recognition, inventory, depreciation, and understanding the accounting equation. The course focuses initially on how to record economic events in the accounting records (i.e., bookkeeping and accrual accounting) and how to prepare and interpret the primary financial statements that summarize a firm's economic transactions (i.e., the balance sheet, the income statement, and the statement of cash flows). The course adopts a decision-maker perspective of accounting by emphasizing the relation between accounting data and the underlying economic events that generated them thereby enabling the students to read, understand and analyse financial statements through ratio analysis. The course also explores the areas of financial shenanigans wherein the students will be able to learn how companies use financial statements to disguise economic reality.</span><br><br>

Human behavior leads to multiple negative outcomes at organizational  units of individuals , teams and groups.The  way people may behave in organisations may not be always beneficial. Dark side behaviors typically lead to negative outcomes. Those who engage in these negative behaviors generally are aware that their actions can cause harm to others, their employer, and/or to them; hence, the instigator usually has intent. It is essential for tomorrow’s managers to understand what are these behaviors how some times they may lead to functional outcomes, sometimes it may lead to nehative outcomes as well. It is essential that we understand these behaviors, as well as control, prevent, mitigate, or ameliorate their occurrences. I.  Aim of the course is to understand what might be source of such behaviors in organizations and  is it possible to mitigate such behaviors in organizational units.   																																					 														        </span><br><br>

People working in organizations get affected not just by who they are, but also but who they are working with and aspects like their teams, leaders, organizational culture, change and communication. The course shifts away from the individual level to the group, and organizational levels of behavior drawing on concepts and practices from the field of Organizational Behavior (OB). This course provides a basic understanding of your own and others’ behavior, particularly in teams. It enhances your ability to communicate and work effectively with others.  Organization requires effective management of people and a clear understanding of human behavior and social processes. Managers need to have a good understanding both of themselves and of those whom they will lead. The prior knowledge of individuals’ perceptions, attitudes, and behavior will enable you to choose appropriate leadership styles and managerial practices to increase organization effectiveness and positive human outcomes.</span><br><br>

It aims to provide a basic and comprehensive understanding of the key fundamental concepts and topics necessary to understand an economy as a whole. 
In addition to introducing the various economic concepts like GDP, inflation, unemployment, interest rates etc., we will also understand their inter-linkages. For this purpose, we will study various markets that operate in any economy, viz., goods, money, capital, and labor markets. And, look at their interdependencies using a narrative-based approach where concepts will be revisited as and when required in order to complete the understanding loop.
Though there will be mathematical representation using equations and graphs. But the focus will be more on intuition in terms of understanding the underlying behavior which results in those representations.

The critical source of   competitive advantage for these corporations is not their physical assets, but their people. It is people, not companies, who innovate, create new products, make decisions, develop and   implement business plans, penetrate new markets, and serve clients and customers.

Understanding consumer behaviour needs an interdisciplinary approach – concepts and methods from several disciplines like neuromarketing, cognitive psychology, behavioural economics, anthropology, sociology, and more. Consumers often make irrational choices. Decisions are based on emotions and unconscious motivations – not only on rational logic. Consumer choices are implicit not explicit. Consumers cannot often express their motivations in response to traditional marketing research surveys. This is because consumers either won’t say why they made some choices (as the answers might not sound logical and reasonable) or they can’t say (as choices were made at an unconscious level and they themselves do not know why they choose a brand). The course will draw on the works of several neuroscientists and behavioural economists like Daniel Kahneman, Richard Thaler, and Dan Ariely. We will use behavioural economics experiments (‘Nudge’ as Richard Thaler calls it) to see how subtle interventions influence brand choices. We will explore how ethnography – a method of immersing oneself in consumer lives (used in anthropology and sociology) – can help us get under the skin of the consumer and observe the role of products and brands in consumer life, as lived and not as claimed in surveys. 																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

It becomes inevitable that the brand language be effectively transformed from one media to another without changing the brand image. Throughout this course, the focus would be to expose students to ideas, applications, experiences and opportunities that are relevant to today’s times. This course is primarily about creating visual artefacts that communicate effectively, but that does not mean you need to be an artist to succeed. Assessment will focus upon your efforts and your willingness to engage with your classmates to provide feedback and learn from one another. The more time you spend with the exercises in this course, the more skills you will develop as a visual communicator. Take the time to explore each exercise, take risks, and reiterate often. Don’t allow your first attempt at any solution to be your only attempt. Fail early and fail often. Learning what doesn’t work is an essential process in understanding what does work.

Services are intangible, highly variable, not storable or transportable and often involve distributed operations with a significant amount of customer contact.

										<td><br><span>Human resource management is the process of gaining a competitive advantage through
people. Organizational performance is driven by people, and it depends on certain measures.
Human Resource (HR) experts need to be skilled at planning and interpreting organizations'
people metrics. This requires a solid understanding of HR analytics, i.e., the systematic
collection, analysis, and interpretation of data considered to improve decisions about talent
and moreover the organization at large. The application of analytics is changing the way HR
managers quantify the value that people (i.e., talent) - a company’s biggest asset - have on the
organization's ability to succeed in the market or in its mission. For enabling managers to make
smart decisions about talent, HR needs to effectually leverage data. When equipped with
metrics that are suitably designed and easy to interpret, HR can render managers with
analytics to make decisions which will not only improve operations nonetheless also create
systemic advantages. Data and sophisticated analysis are brought in the dynamics to
effectively handle people-related issues viz., recruiting, hiring and promotion, performance
evaluation, leadership, collaboration, job design, and compensation.
The curriculum is of an introductory nature to the theory of people analytics. It is not intended
to prepare learners to perform complex talent management data analysis. At the conclusion of
this course, you will be able to understand that how and when hard data is operated to make
soft-skill decisions about hiring and talent development; therefore, you may level yourself as a
strategic partner in the company’s talent management decisions.
The course will help students in three distinct ways. One, it will provide students with the latest
grounding in current evidence on managing people, providing a knowledge base which shall
ensure that their future management is led by the best practices. Second, develop the
understanding and skills that are necessary to be thoughtful, critical consumers of data on
people management, allowing them to make an in-depth analysis as they make people
decisions. Third, provide direction and practice in conducting people analytics, preparing
students to gather their own data, and making students more skilled analysts. These goals will
be pursued through a mixture of case discussion, lecture, and hands-on exploration of a variety
of data sets. The course is intended to introduce you to the fact that Organizations flourish
when the people who work in them flourish. Analytics can help make both happen.</span><br><br>

Despite billions of dollars spent on cancer research every year we are still far from an universal cure for cancer. However as a result of this research our understanding of cancer has improved tremendously & we are able to treat many tumors quite successfully. This understanding has also led to a better understanding of normal cellular processes of growth & differentiation in many cases. This course will introduce you to basic mechanisms of tumorigenesis, expose you to some success stories in treating cancer & sensitize you to the heterogeneity of the disease we call cancer. 																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

MUS101 tries to address these questions by exploring and interrogating the existing genres of Indian Music like Tribal-Folk, Classical-Art, Popular, Devotional and Fusion Music. It focuses on the key principles of music that formulate these genres and connect them to each other, the connection which eventually weaves the complex and diverse fabric called ‘Indian Music’. The course also tries to understand the relationship of culture and music through the dynamics of above mentioned genres. This course combines Theory and Practice thus students are expected to perform some vocals and also do some writing during the course. </span><br><br>

Similar in spirit to the basic introductory political science courses at the undergraduate level in India, this course provides a descriptive overview of the formation and functioning of Indian state by looking at institutional dynamics of various public institutions since independence. The course will also help students to understand the evolution of Indian politics since 1947 by examining changes in social movements and interest groups and the myriad ways in which their demands are channeled by political parties and the Indian state. Through this course, students will also develop an appreciation for the historical roots of contemporary political developments like: changing party systems, rise of Hindu nationalism, and agrarian crisis in 21st Century among others. </span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>The city of Ahmedabad has been at the crossroads of major historical currents. A key commercial centre of western India, Ahmedabad was at the vanguard of industrialisation in modern India. Ahmedabad via the coastal port cities such as Surat was a gateway to the sea routes of the Indian Ocean via the Arabian Sea, home to influences from West Asia as well as peninsular South Asia. Although the city functioned as a political and administrative centre, it had a strong tradition of craft goods production, merchant entrepreneurship, and banking and financial services.  It maintained thriving trade contacts with  neighbouring towns and port cities as well as imperial centres at Delhi and Agra. In 1700 AD, Ahmedabad was, by some estimates, the sixth most populous city in the world[1]. Today, it continues as one of the most populous cities in India, a key node of national politics as well as business and urban development initiatives and emblematic of the opportunities and challenges before contemporary Indian society, wherein modernist development paradigms have been superimposed on traditional social structures. The course will help students understand the city as an arena for economic activities (industry, trade and commerce, and informal work), merchant communities, entrepreneurship, city life and culture, and global engagement over the centuries. It will also examine the causes and consequences of conflicts over material and symbolic resources, which have been key to the social organisation of the city. It examines various efforts at urban development charting the city’s built form for the future. Through a combination of lectures, classroom discussions, and projects the course encourages students to analyse these historical and contemporary processes in Ahmedabad in the wider historical context of Gujarat. Through these experiences, students will receive an introduction to disciplinary concepts and theories that will be built upon systematically by later courses in the student’s chosen major.‘Ahmedabad as a Gateway to the World’ is a mandatory course for all BA students majoring in History or SPS (Social and Political Sciences), and for all Integrated MBA students.

										<td><br><span>This course is the first of a set of two courses where students will learn scholastic Sanskrit through exercises drawn from various Sanskrit literary sources, such as well-known subhāṣitas, Pañcatantra, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, etc. In this course, students will be introduced gradually to various aspects of Sanskrit morphology and syntax so as to enable them to read simple Sanskrit sentences and verses. Exercises (sentences, verses and passages) for each class will be drawn from original Sanskrit works (brief description below), and will be chosen so as to exemplify the key grammatical features which need to be explained.  																																					 														         The Pañcatantra is a famous collection of Sanskrit stories, in verse and prose, dated to around the second/third century CE and is considered a nītiśāstra (a treatise on government or political science). The Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa is one of the two famous Indian epics, a mammoth work comprising nearly 24,000 verses and which is of monumental importance and legacy.  Each class will be divided into three segments: a revision of the past lesson(s) (and review of assigned after-class exercises), the scheduled lesson, and in-class exercises taken from Sanskrit literature. There will also be surprise tests to further reinforce the learning of various grammatical features.   This course will prepare students to take the second of this set of courses (SAN102), wherein students will study more advanced syntactical aspects of the language. These two courses will prepare students with the adequate training in Sanskrit grammar to begin their study of original Sanskrit works in their second year of Sanskrit study (SAN201 and SAN202). Knowledge of the Devanāgarī script is not a prerequisite for this course. This is a core course for the Minor in Sanskrit Studies.</span><br><br>

What is the social significance of marriage and how do we critically examine its current glossy, romanticized reinventions as elaborately staged spectacles? What is the significance of caste in our lives, and what is its place in Indian society? How does the Indian Constitution view caste? What is the relationship of religion to the state? Should it be private and contained within families, or spill over into streets and processions? Why have religious minorities, Dalits, and other groups at the ‘margin’ consistently challenged the idea of nationalism?  
This course builds on the understanding of the production of social identities in the introductory courses of the Social and Political Sciences programme and aims to develop a stronger theoretical foundation for analyzing key social categories. In this course, students will engage with a selection of texts focusing on categorizations along the lines of gender, family, caste, religion, language, and nation. Students will learn to critically examine these categories, their inter-connections, and the processes through which they are reproduced in everyday life.

In this endeavour, the cultural context is of crucial importance on account of the social, historical, and ecological distinctiveness of human experiences. Developmental Psychology also takes an integrative perspective on domains of activity like physical and motor, social relationships, emotions, cognition, language, morality and emotional, cognition and language, emotional aspects and moral dimensions. Furthermore, the study of development is contextually embedded in family, schools, peer groups, neighbourhoods and society, looking both at normative as well as idiographic patterns. Issues of developmental difference and disability will also be addressed with focus on developmentally and culturally appropriate interventions. </span><br><br>

We will read these primary sources in the original (and in the case of Hind Swaraj in translation) to explore the divergent ideas of India that emerged through the writings of the three barristers, wherein categories like caste, nation and people became contested. We will locate these texts – and the writers – in the wider context of the British colonialism and the conversations around the emergent nationhood. Along with the primary texts, we will also read a few contemporary scholarship on these texts – and their authors – such as Ajay Skaria (2016), Anupama Rao (2009), Aishwary Kumar (2015), Kapila and Devji (2010), Joseph Alter (2000), etc.</span><br><br>

Be it the electronic instruments we use today, be it the development of solar cells as a renewable source of energy, be it the spectroscopy that we need for any biological or chemical discoveries, there is hardly any sphere of activities that does not need quantum mechanics. In this course the students will be exposed to this subject which involves the most dramatic departure from our understanding of the macroscopic world at the microscopic scales. Students will be introduced the probabilistic concepts in studying the microscopic world which involves both new theoretical developments as well as rigorous mathematical concepts from linear algebra, differential equations and many more. In Quantum Mechanics I, to start with, the failure of classical physics in the microscopic world will be discussed in terms of some very important experiments. Subsequently the idea of quantum mechanics will be introduced. Finally few simple quantum mechanical systems will be introduced and related mathematical concepts will be taught.</span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>What research methods do social scientists use to understand phenomena such as human experiences, processes, events, relations and networks? What does ‘fieldwork’ entail, and how do researchers define and construct a field? How do social scientists establish the validity, rigour and verifiability of their research questions and hypothesis, while remaining open to the inherently unstable nature of social relations? This course introduces students to research methods in the social sciences through a combination of reading, discussion and fieldwork practice. Alongside tracing some of the key debates that have arisen in qualitative social science methodology, students will learn about new and evolving modes of virtual qualitative field work such as navigating digital and remote sites of research students and the ethics and power dynamics implicit in conducting qualitative research. Each week students will learn about the practical skills as well as the theoretical aspects of conducting social science research. Through a series of practical writing assignments, in-class workshops and peer projects, students will learn key research skills— formulating  a research question, identifying an empirical research site, sourcing informants, rapport building, conducting interviews and practicing field note techniques. The teaching of research methods will proceed through a close reading of select texts, each of which highlight the possibilities and limits of particular methods- such as interviews, case studies, participant observation, etc. The last third of the course will be devoted to a short on-campus research project in groups or pairs where students will test the methods and approaches they have studied. The course is envisaged as a  stepping stone to help students embarking on their undergraduate thesis projects. 

The course is also designed as a methods course for graduate students in the interdisciplinary humanities and social sciences. For graduate students, the course will proceed as a reading course which enables them to start thinking critically about key debates in the social sciences, and the methods best suited to their own topic of study.

										<td><br><span>In this survey course, we will explore topics in metaphysics and epistemology in the key texts of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Western philosophy. This period is the era of the emergence of the natural sciences, and several philosophical debates from this time remain influential in contemporary philosophy.
We will concern ourselves with the following questions: What is the ultimate structure of reality? How might we think of the nature, source and limits of knowledge? Can we rationally prove the existence of God? What is the nature of space and time? How does the mind relate to the body? What is the nature of personal identity? Are our actions really free? In addressing these questions, we will learn about a variety of philosophical positions like rationalism, empiricism, idealism, dualism, monism, and materialism.This course is open to all students. It is a core course for students pursuing a Minor in Philosophy.</span><br><br>

Research is an attempt to understand the world through systematic study—that is, through identification of a problem, question, or hypothesis; selection of methods to investigate the question, collecting data, interpreting data, and reporting findings. The process of designing and doing research is a mix of various elements including the world view and social location of the researcher (researcher positionality), the selection of what one wants to investigate (research problem/question), and how one goes about doing it (research methods). This introductory and project-based course will familiarize students with the philosophical underpinnings of research, and enable them to identify, compare and contrast different qualitative and quantitative research methods suitable for answering a question, apply their understanding to design a research project in small groups, collect and analyse data, and demonstrate basics of academic writing.</span><br><br>

On the other hand, guardians of a civil society – usually the ruled in a democracy, such as citizens, mass media and human rights activists – have exclaimed that power has been in abuse. Even those who are apathetic or indifferent among ordinary people with politics, become awakened by the political impact that secrecy has once it is revealed as scandals. We have no way of gauging the relevant successful cases of secret statecraft and government secrecy in general since we know very little about the whole cases of national leaders’ covert attempts to engage in government secrecy. As a result, we cannot be even certain whether cases of revelation are typical or atypical, or whether revelations were a result of government secrecy failures to reassure or other factors. Empirical evidence to prove or disprove government secrecy theories, thus, could be more speculative by necessity, but it is possible to test some theories with the limited information that can be gleaned from historical records and in social science manners, such as hypothetical deductive approaches. Therefore, through this course on intelligence and government secrecy, undergraduate students will ask themselves what secrecy is in the first place and what are the possible future challenges pertinent we have to face. Furthermore, since intelligence and govern secrecy studies pose many ethical and moral questions – for example, “Is secrecy itself necessary in intelligence?” “If so, how much secrecy do we need? And at what cost?” – this course challenges undergraduate students to face these very fundamental questions. Although these are tough questions to answer, they are worthwhile to look into. Additionally, technologies and intelligence tools change over time, so another question is, what legitimizes various types of intelligence collection activities like the eavesdropping of by? National Security Agency? How far does the government’s responsibility go and should go? These questions will prepare students for actual government jobs which social and political science major students, and any students, are mostly pursuing.  The course on intelligence and government secrecy is an intellectual journey that prepares undergraduate students to real-world politics where their survival skills are required and their innovative thoughts and ideas are needed.

Psychologists empirically study mind and behaviour while philosophers (of mind) conceptually analyse and develop arguments about the nature of mind/behaviour. However, there is a cross-pollination between Philosophy and Psychology. Often, the insights developed by philosophers guide the empirical work of psychologists, and similarly, the empirical findings of psychologists have implications for philosophical/theoretical accounts of mind/behaviour. In this spirit, this course discusses the broad theoretical and philosophical implications of the findings of Psychology, particularly with respect to the psychological processes of consciousness, thinking, rationality, free will, and social minds. However, it should be clarified that this course is distinct from traditional “Philosophy of Mind” courses which tend to focus on the fundamental nature of the mind; this course focuses on the empirical findings in Psychology and their theoretical (or philosophical) implications. The sample of the theoretical/philosophical implications of the empirical findings of Psychology include: (a) Do limited resource models of attention imply that we do not see everything that we could see? (b) Do we need language to think? (c) Do we possess the processes to acquire accurate knowledge about ourselves? (d) Why aren’t we always rational? (e) Do we have free will? and (f) What is the role of self-knowledge in understanding other minds?</span><br><br>

																Theatre has evolved through time as an important tool of expression and communication.  It is not only a source of entertainment but can serve as a catalyst for social reform or development. Theatre also expands our connection to the larger world around us, and our empathy for lives lived differently from our own. A director or an actor thinks from the perspective of the diverse characters they portray, improving tolerance towards others in the society. The audience, in turn, becomes witness to worlds that they might otherwise not encounter or be familiar with. Studies have also shown that students who participate in theatre perform better in academics as it enhances their power to express themselves.This course aims to introduce students to the different forms and functions of theatre, inclusive of the wide range of roles theatre practitioners can take on, such as directing, acting and scriptwriting.  We will also simultaneously discuss how theatre relates to societal concerns, using theatre games to help students to find present day issues that are relevant to them. Importantly, we will work together on producing skits and script writing in peer groups to encourage students to work cohesively in groups, overcome their inhibitions and find the confidence to engage in creative self-expression.This course is at beginner level & doesn’t require prior theatre experience. It is open to all students at the University. It will run for  one session a week (for 3 hours) as in a lab course. It is offered by Kabir Thakore, the Director of the Scrapyard Theatre in Ahmedabad.

																The notion of a “group,” viewed only 30 years ago as the epitome of sophistication, is today one of the mathematical concepts most widely used in physics, chemistry, biochemistry, and mathematics itself. – Alexey Sosinsky, 1991This undergraduate course focuses on traditional algebra topics that have found greatest application in science and engineering as well as in mathematics. The power of abstract algebra is embedded in its name: it gives us an arena in which we may study disparate mathematical objects together and abstractly, without considering a particular instance or occurrence. For example, the multiplication of numbers, symmetries of a molecule, dance formations, roots of polynomials, Australian kin systems, actions of a Rubik’s cube, and loops on surfaces all form groups. The main objects of study, in this course, are groups, which are abstract mathematical objects that reflect the most basic features of many other mathematical constructions. We will also study fields and other abstract mathematical objects, which can be thought of as groups with additional structure. Topics include group theory, emphasising finite groups; field theory, including properties and applications of finite fields.

										<td><br><span>This course will teach students to critically and qualitatively examine “development” as a practice that is used to organize and govern the world.  Drawing on the disciplines of anthropology, sociology, political science, the course will take students through the history and transformation of developmentalist thinking. Students will understand how ideas about what development means have changed over time, and be able to then examine for themselves how the culture and politics, especially of India, has changed accordingly.We will read how development has been researched qualitatively, through ethnographies (long-term case studies) of the targets of development interventions, and use such ground-up perspectives to evaluate the successes and failures of development holistically. The course will examine specific thrust areas of development such as gender equality, tribal upliftment, environmental protection in terms of their achievements and shortcomings. The course is distributed into four modules that will examine (a) anthropological approaches to development and the history of development; (b)critiques of development and its power; (c) local negotiations with development interventions, and (d) new concepts beyond development. The course will thus familiarize students with the theories and concepts that have emerged to voice the various discontents with developmentalist ideas and policies.  For any student planning to enter the development sector, be a benefactor, or simply an interested citizen, this course will give them the tools to engage with the phenomenon through a historical and critical lens.</span><br><br>

														        This course is designed to help students research and write their BA thesis or capstone project in the Social and Political Sciences. The class will enable them to adopt a structured approach to working on their thesis by setting concrete deadlines with well-defined tasks for each week. This includes approaching and finalising a faculty advisor in the first month of the course, who will guide them towards relevant literature, approaches and methodology. The course will facilitate them  to reflect on their writing both in terms of its style and content. We will draw on texts that explain the skill-sets needed to enhance the practice of research and writing. The course will also help students develop as a collegial academic, able to engage with the works of their colleagues, provide constructive criticism and judiciously incorporate feedback from others into their work. By the end of the course they will have a proposal of a thesis or capstone project, with first drafts of each component of a thesis or a project, that they will continue to polish over the rest of the academic year.</span><br><br>

																This is a global history core course for History Major.

The course considers the agency of trade and religion in mediating cultural identities in the Indian Ocean world. Trade involves the exchange of goods. Long-distance trade requires merchants to enter into exchange relationships with people from other cultures. Trade contacts facilitate reciprocal understanding by intersecting with myriad other aspects of human life including religious beliefs. Religion is often defined as a frozen set of precepts, rituals, and moral codes of behaviour. Contrary to this, religion in the early modern period (c. 1500 – c. 1800) exhibited an extraordinary dynamism and fluidity as it moved across geographies. By focusing on trade and religion in the Indian Ocean world, the course discusses the changing perceptions of different social groups as they came into closer contact. 

The Indian Ocean has been one of the oldest world regions that facilitated trade and cultural interactions. The exchange of goods, ideas, technologies, microbes, and plants was often mediated by merchants, mercenaries, and monks straddling across the Indian Ocean regions. In the early modern period, the diversity of peoples from Southeast Asia, South Asia, the Islamic heartlands, East Africa and Europe made the Indian Ocean an emerging globalising arena that brought multiple cultures and religions to closely interact. This led to the processes of identity formation, dissemination and adaptation of cultural practices, and contestations and compromises in forging an open, cosmopolitan society. Understanding this substratum of the historical past will enable us to better understand globalisation.

										<td><br><span>This Enable course will serve as a major elective for the Social and Political Sciences (SPS) and as a free elective or Social Science GER for students from across the university.This course introduces students to the study of one of the most prevailing and oldest social categories across the world: religion. It specifically uses ethnographies – records, monographs, accounts of people, their culture or society based on extended fieldwork – to engage with religion as a category for analysis. Rather than an overview of multiple religions, the course is interested in exploring questions and ideas around power and practice, and engagements with and beyond the human.
																																					
														        
The course revolves around major themes that illustrate the study of religion: tradition, myth, ritual, priesthood, self and other, rationality, symbols, secularism, and modernity. It will inform students how religion structures society and disciplines selves. The course will challenge preconceived notions of religion and introduce students to critically examine embodied and ensouled systems.
Sessions will be divided into two components: one will focus on theoretical approaches, concepts, and trends; while the other will attend to select ethnographies and orient students towards field approaches. Readings will be a mix of classics, contemporary debates, short films, and ethnographies. Students will be introduced to reading ethnographies, collecting field data, and writing ethnographic notes. 
The course is valuable to students across the disciplines of History, Philosophy, Psychology, and Social and Political Sciences. It will also help students prepare for their Undergraduate thesis.

Students will learn the fundamentals of the painting process while exploring different mediums including acrylic, water colour, and oil, and also paper, canvas, and panels as support. Though this course is intended as an introduction to the methods, materials, and techniques associated with painting, discussions of art history will establish a context for understanding the discipline of painting more fully.
																					
														        																					
														        																					
														        																					
														        This course is also an introduction to objective observation of the world as we see it - not as we think we see it and rendering that view in artwork. Beginning with basic principles of painting, this course will continue to challenge and build students’ skill as a painter through representational, abstract, and non-representational style of painting. Among other traditional subject matters including still life, landscapes and cityscapes, our exploration may even include renderings of machines and biological specimens. Studio sessions will be majorly spent making paintings, which will touch upon concepts crucial to the creative process, including critical thinking, discipline, and spontaneity.
Students will complete this course with a basic but strong understanding of making paintings, and also develop competency, both visual and technical, involved in painting. The goal of this course is to give students the basic tools and ideas necessary to begin their own personal painting practice along with finding a means for self-expression through the medium of painting.</span><br><br>

While drawing is often seen as a primary tool supporting creative research within art practice, this course will also consider drawing as an independent and intimate approach that offers a keen insight to both the creative process and one’s emotional state. To that end, it is a studio-practice course aided by strong contextual studies that will enable students to develop basic rendering skills, understand drawing as a form of action and gesture that is an affirmation of life. Students will be able to objectively perceive the world we live in, which forms the crux of art-making in any art form – including printmaking, photography, painting, and digital art.

This will also be supplemented with museum and gallery visits in the Ahmedabad city.
Sketchbooks will be an important component in this course; students will explore self-expression and alternative drawing methods as a part of their required initiative.
Students will complete this course with a strong understanding of what constitutes as drawing, and also develop technical skill and competency in the drawing process. The goal of this course is to perceive action and gesture as means to create art while also laying a strong foundation for anyone who wants to pursue other forms of art.</span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>Real Analysis is one of the foundational courses in Mathematics. It demonstrates the need for mathematical rigor in dealing with fundamental mathematical concepts, for example, the construction of real numbers, the concept of infinity, and the idea of a limit.  Real Analysis is useful in many fields in mathematics, such as Complex Analysis, Functional Analysis, Harmonic Analysis (including Fourier Analysis), Approximation Theory, Numerical Analysis, Dynamical Systems, Wavelets, Nonlinear Optimization, Partial Differential Equations, etc. Real analysis (including Measure Theory) forms the foundation of modern Probability Theory and finds applications in Economics, Finance, Network Simulations, etc. For example, concepts of Real Analysis are used in Economics in Classical Demand Theory (for example, in studying the n-dimensional commodity space R^n), in Marginal Analysis and in problems involving Constrained Optimization (for example, in the Utility Maximization Problem).  
This course will provide a rigorous foundation for the concepts discussed in courses on Introductory Calculus. The course will introduce rigorous Real Analysis at an elementary level and will cover the following main topics.
•	Well Ordering principle and the principle of Mathematical Induction
•	Countable and uncountable infinity
•	Formal construction of Real Numbers (R)
•	Properties of R
•	Sequences
•	Series
•	Limits
•	Continuity
•	Differentiation
•	Riemann Integral</span><br><br>

Underlying this diversity are fundamental elements that derive from the physicality of music as sound and its transformation into art.  This course is for those who are curious about discovering these fundamental elements of music.  Beginning with basic features of sound – frequency, amplitude, duration and wave form – that may be mapped to fundamental musical elements of pitch, loudness, time, and timbre, the course will explore elements such as melody, harmony, time, rhythm, texture, dynamics, instrumentation etc.</span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>This course is a rigorous introduction to the physiology and biophysics of excitable cells. These cells include neurons and muscle cells (skeletal and cardiac). Three broad topics will be covered: 1) the biophysics of electrically excitable membranes, 2) the cause and effect of membrane excitability on cell signalling, and 3) synaptic processes. Topics include electrochemical and osmotic equilibrium, the role of passive and active channels in determining the membrane potential, action potential generation and propagation, experimental methods to measure ion channel properties and the electrical properties of semipermeable membranes, and the process of neurotransmitter release at chemical synapses. These concepts will be extended to excitability in skeletal muscle, and cardiac muscle and pacemaker cells, muscle contraction, and regulation of muscle contraction. If time permits, we will cover the electric organ of electric fish. This is a course in cellular physiology and biophysics, and so it covers basic principles and mechanisms at the cellular level rather than systems. At the end of the course, students will be able to understand the physiological and biophysical mechanisms by which nerve and muscle cells function. This course is a prerequisite for BIO 320 (Neurobiology) which covers nervous system function in depth. BIO 319 and 320 are offered in alternate years.</span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>We wear global brands, consume global media, enjoy world cuisine, and use westernized slang. We wish to study, work or settle ‘abroad’. Simultaneously, we remain passionately attached to national identities, personal communities and local products, practices and norms. Such contradictions are now a part of our everyday lives but are undergirded by complex historical processes of movement and flow- of production processes, labour, capital, technology and ideas. 
This course aims to ‘locate’ globalization, not by treating global and local as binaries, but by studying different approaches, understandings and critiques of what remains a slippery process and concept. Rather than treating globalization as an analytically isolable object, process or phenomenon, we try to understand how it is embedded in production, value, consumption, desire and politics. Thus, the course will cover broad themes including economic globalization, cultural globalization, political, technological and ecological globalization. The course will engage with abstract theories of globalization and also its concrete manifestations in different parts of the world. Finally, the course, will complicate salutary narratives of globalization by looking at questions of rising income inequality, cultural nationalisms and ecological crisis. 
Course material will comprise mainly book chapters and academic journal articles, complemented by commentaries in reputed global journals and videos and film where relevant.

It often involves theatrical performances that address social or political issues, using creative and interactive techniques to engage with the audience. Street theatre is theatre which goes to the people and performed among them, and has potential to create significant awareness about critical issues of society.
The aim of this course is to make aware students about social issues around them that need to be addressed, and present it in a creative and effective way in front of concerned group of people. Students - often described as engine of change for any society - will learn to produce their street theatre performances while also understanding its legacy through the history of art.

One of the first questions one asks related to such discrete mathematical structures is 'How many of a certain kind are there?'. In this course, we will understand what is meant by counting discrete mathematical structures and what constitutes a good answer to such a counting question.Discrete mathematics has applications in a variety of fields and lies at the intersection of pure mathematics, applied mathematics, and computer science. This course will showcase certain objects that appear in various situations encompassing not only mathematics and computer science but also physics. While studying these objects we will also understand some of the most fundamental tools and techniques in combinatorics. If you have enjoyed solving puzzles such as 'How many ways can you tile a 2 x n board using dominoes' or ever wondered how the number of binary trees grows then you will enjoy this course. In particular, we will answer both of these questions in the course (one of them in the first week and the other towards the end of the course).</span><br><br>

One of the first questions one asks related to such discrete mathematical structures is 'How many of a certain kind are there?'. In this course, we will understand what is meant by counting discrete mathematical structures and what constitutes a good answer to such a counting question.

Discrete mathematics has applications in a variety of fields and lies at the intersection of pure mathematics, applied mathematics, and computer science. This course will showcase certain objects that appear in various situations encompassing not only mathematics and computer science but also physics. While studying these objects we will also understand some of the most fundamental tools and techniques in combinatorics. If you have enjoyed solving puzzles such as 'How many ways can you tile a 2 x n board using dominoes' or ever wondered how the number of binary trees grows then you will enjoy this course. In particular, we will answer both of these questions in the course (one of them in the first week and the other towards the end of the course).</span> 										</td>

The course deals with experimental techniques required to study perceptual, cognitive and social psychological processes. The emphasis is on providing students with hands-on experience in conceiving, designing, executing and interpreting psychological experiments. The course aims to help students to apply their conceptual knowledge in psychological processes into creating novel experiments. The course offers hands-on training in experimentation on human participants. The theoretical principles and paradigmatic fundamentals associated with each experimental technique are also discussed during the session. The course focuses on five psychological processes, and students will learn to replicate recent experiments that probe these processes. The five processes include perception, attention, learning/memory, decision-making and social cognition. The course aims to guide students to critically read empirical studies, identify methodological issues and research gaps. The course encourages the student to design and perform experiments that study human mind and behaviour.</span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>[Course Title: “Śabda, Artha, Rasa: Contours of Indian Philosophy of Language” – AURIS is unable to show the title correctly due to the special character]The use of language is amongst the most ubiquitous of human activities – present across cultures, geographies and times – and, one may argue, can also be considered as the singular characteristic that distinguishes our species from all others. Our unceasing application of language, however, does not imply our complete understanding of this marvel of human experience. Philosophical speculations on the nature of language are found in the Indian tradition as early as the Ṛgveda (c.1400-1000 BCE) and several conceptions were meticulously discussed by later thinkers and schools (darśana). In this course, we will look at four pivotal topics of philosophical concern on the nature of language and consider the doctrines developed within the Sanskritic tradition by studying directly from four seminal texts:(i) What is a word – is it to be conflated with the individual phonemes that comprise it (say, “c”, “o” and “w” in “cow”), or is it a unitary entity beyond these? Primary text: The Sphoṭasiddhi of Maṇḍana Miśra (c.7th century CE)(ii) What is word-meaning – does a word (like “cow”, say) denote an individual object or a generic property, or something else entirely? Primary text: The chapter Apohavāda from the Ślokavārttika of Kumārila Bhaṭṭa (c.7th century CE) (iii) What is sentence-meaning – how does a collection of words, when uttered in a certain order, give rise to a meaning entirely distinct from that of any of them? Primary text: The chapter Vākyārthamātṛkā-II from the Prakaraṇapañcikā of Śālikanātha Miśra (c.10th century CE)(iv) What is poetic-meaning – how do poetic sentences convey a meaning altogether distinct from the literal meaning of the sentence? Primary text: The Dhvanyāloka of Ānandavardhana (c.9th century CE), with the commentary Locana of Abhinavagupta (c.10th century CE)Students will thus be introduced to the wide variety of methodological approaches to the study of Indian Philosophy (historical-philological, philosophical, etc.) over the past century as well as the trends in current scholarship. The course will also seek to demonstrate briefly convergences as well as divergences between the Indian doctrines and contemporary (Anglo-European) theories. This course thus aims to prepare students for advanced studies and research in Philosophy.The prerequisite for this 400-level PHI course is the completion of any one 200- or 300- level PHI / PHL course. This may be waived only after explicit approval from the Instructor. Knowledge of Sanskrit is not a prerequisite for this course as students will study all texts in English translation, but students are encouraged to take up (at least) the introductory course on Sanskrit (SAN101) to aid their understanding. </span><br><br>

In parallel, we will discuss the work of a few literary critics interpreting these texts. Through these short stories, students will become familiar with the basic literary nuances of the genre, such as the sensibilities, narrative techniques, complexity of the plot and characters, setting of the story, the element of tension, and the like. They will understand how the short story as a creative genre is rooted in a specific historical context along with the theoretical-ideological viewpoint of the story writer. The Qissa Goi or Dastangoi (storytelling) tradition is older than the languages. The primitive humans started telling the stories as wall paintings in caves like the Maros-Pangkep Karst or Bhimbetka. Oral kathas have been the basis of epics like Ramayana-Mahabharata or the Iliad and Odyssey. Still, as a modern genre, the kahani(short story) differs from Lok Katha, the epics, and qissa.</span> 										</td>

The goal is to change the common perception of how biological and allied applied sciences students perceive statistics and present statistics as tools of reasoning and data collection and analysis science. An effective way to do that is to base a course on computation and real data analysis with widely used statistical programming language R. So, analysis of real data sets would be a key component of teaching and evaluation. Data from various fields in biology will be used as examples and exercises and as aids in learning how to use statistical procedures.</span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>Vedānta means the “end” or the “essence” of the Veda and the term is often used to refer to the Upaniṣads. With the composition of the Brahmasūtras/ Vedāntasūtras (c.400-450 CE), the philosophy contained in the Upaniṣads was systematized. In the eighth century CE, Śaṅkarācārya wrote a commentary on some Upaniṣads and the Brahmasūtras providing an advaita (non-dualist) interpretation of the Vedāntic texts. Further, scholars including Rāmānuja (12th century), Madhva (13th century), Vallabha (15th-16th century), and Appayyā Dīkṣita (16th century) presented their own interpretations of Vedānta. 

Today, Vedānta is probably the most recognisable of the premodern Brahmanical systems of thought, with Vedanta Centres peppering various parts of the world. In some popular understandings informed by developments in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, a kind of vague non-dualism which passes off for Vedānta is often even taken to be the “essence” of “Indian philosophy”.

This course aims to introduce students to certain aspects of the origins and history of different kinds of Vedānta. The attempt is to present Vedānta as a part of the broader intellectual history of South Asia while demonstrating the complexity and richness of the discourse it generated.

This course provides an introduction to the complexities of animal behaviour, and how it is studied. Students will explore the various behaviours animals adopt in order to meet the challenges of their daily lives. We begin with how animals learn and communicate with each other, then move on to discuss how they find food, avoid predators, choose their mates, and rear their offspring. This course is aimed at anyone looking to broaden their understanding of animal behaviour beyond nature documentaries or a typical high school education. No previous knowledge is required, only curiosity and enthusiasm for the subject.</span><br><br>

Evolutionary Biology is the study of the changes in life forms over time - changes that have occurred over millions of years as well as those that have occurred over just a few decades. In this course, we will look at the various mechanisms of evolution, how these mechanisms work, and how change is measured. This course will begin by reviewing the evolutionary concepts of selection and speciation, phylogenetics and history of life. We will then learn natural selection and adaptation, evolutionary processes, and genes-genomes-phenotypes. The course will wrap up with a look at the evolution and modern society. At the end of this course, students will have a better understanding of the evolution of life. Also, this course will prepare students for future study and research in macroevolution, microevolution, genetics, behavioral biology, evolutionary medicine, and computational biology.																																					 																																			 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

PGMs bring together graph theory and probability theory and provide a flexible framework for modelling large collections of random variables with complex interactions.  The course will focus mainly on three aspects: A. The core representation, including Bayesian and Markov networks, and dynamic Bayesian networks; B. Probabilistic inference algorithms, both exact and approximate; and C. Learning methods for both the parameters and the structure of graphical models. Students entering the class should have a pre-existing working knowledge of probability, statistics, and algorithms. This class will set the foundation for machine learning, predictive analytics, reinforcement learning, natural language processing etc. Students can apply PGM in any field of core computer science and engineering to handle multidimensional uncertain problems.     																																					 																																			 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>
