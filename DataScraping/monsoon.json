Firms have choices to make if they are to survive and prosper. Those which are strategic include: how to create value, the selection of goals, the choice of products and services to offer; the design and configuration of policies determining how the firm positions itself to compete in product-markets (i.e., competitive strategy); the choice of an appropriate level of scope and diversity; the different options in terms of directions and methods of growth - including coopetition. The course also covers the role and impact of technology on modern-day businesses, viz. how technology impacts organizations and how tech-based businesses strategize. Later, we will learn about opportunity identification with a Blue Ocean Strategy approach, before moving onto the last module of the course which focuses on strategy implementation.  ,",

        "Description": "An annual report is a powerful and revealing document about a company\u2019s financial standing. To a trained professional it gives a substantial insight into where a company may be headed in the future. However, to an untrained eye the annual report may seem like walls of accounting technicalities provided to fill space between the glossy photos and the upbeat messages from the CEO. In many aspects, reading an annual report could be a daunting task as it is a mixture of factual financial results and public relation information. There is a wide communication gap between the world of compliance and disclosure. It is difficult to interpret and understand the information provided in slick expensively produced annual reports. There can be no better piece of information about a company than annual reports but it is essential to cut through the marketing clutter in annual reports and extract vital information (financial content) that shows true picture of the company.",

        "Description": "'Business-model' is a buzz word now in boardrooms, especially when the business encounters problems. The managers agree or disagree if the present business model is working any more or it needs navigation. To put it simply, a business model is both a short- and long-term framework of plans and moral rules within which a business operates. If the business model is strong it creates value and business prospers. Reverse happens when the business model is week. Over a period of time, an existing business calibrates its business model in keeping with the surrounding changes to remain relevant otherwise it may perish. A carefully designed business model has an inherent strength but it may not be long lasting. Hence, calibration is necessary from time to time. A rightly calibrated business model can act as a game changer. Today\u2019s business models were imagined a decade ago and we have to create tomorrow\u2019s business model considering many unknown bets.  Therefore, formal education and intelligent hard work are necessary to create a winning business model. Even though there are some generic and popular business models developed by experts, the owners and managers can bypass the standard ones and create a differentiated business model most suited to their businesses. This course mainly deals with identifying and placing various business drivers in sequence and changing it whenever and wherever necessary in order to make competitive business models.\u00a0,",

All products, whether digital or otherwise, must deliver a high-quality user experience or risk losing users to competitors.The focus of interaction design is on user-centred design based on the understanding of real users including their experiences, goals, needs, wants and tasks. The goal of interaction design is also to collect and analyse data to make informed interface design decisions which are critical to creating and delivering successful products, services and systems that fulfil the user/customer, technological and business needs. ,",

        "Description": "Digital Humanities (DH) is the intersection between humanities, technology, design and data analysis. It brings the power of computational analysis to problems and possibilities in humanities and related disciplines.\u00a0This course aims to inform students of transdisciplinary research being undertaken within the purview of DH to equip them with the ability to hypothesise and 'critically-make' new media projects.The students are expected to incorporate a 50:50 ratio in their study of theory and implementing solutions hands-on. Students will be guided to prototype solutions that bridge their primary field of study with the Humanities. The course will result in the culmination of a final project answering a research question. Students will engage closely in a project that results in the culmination of a DH-platform as part of their evaluation.The tools that will primarily be used are Python, Google Collab, miscellaneous OpenAccess methods for text, network, spatial analyses will be encouraged. Students need not have any prior knowledge of these tools to register for this course. The coursework would broadly involve the creation of a data essay, a piece of alternative or multimodal writing and towards the development of an OpenAccess digital platform to highlight digital scholarship in Indian galleries, libraries, archives and museums (GLAM) for he general public.,",

Two prominent issues would be use of open-access natural resources (where property rights are not well defined) and environmental public good provision. Apart from coming up with instruments to deal with these problems, the course would also discuss about market failures related to pollution. The study of the concepts and techniques of environmental valuation would be important. Topics covered would include those related to development and sustainability: the degree of substitutability between natural resources and produced forms of capital (namely physical and human) and limits to growth implied by it. Since economic growth of developing nations often involves rising pollution, the course would also spend some time on discussing the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC). The course concludes with \u201cgreening\u201d the system of national accounts and attempts to include value of environmental services within the national product of countries (including the case for India). The course would be based on rigorous theory, readings of texts and articles and numerical examples.,",

While these technologies promote innovation intending to improve ease of living, they create serious issues on privacy, governance and societal impact. Ethicists have raised concerns over how digital technologies violate the core values of human existence and sought active measures to protect them. Regulating agencies have been looking for ways to regulate these new technologies to protect core human values. The regulatory framework, however, has lagged considerably in regulating technological advancements resulting in a wide gap between the technology and regulatory upgrades. Consequently, there is a growing emphasis on self-regulation by the industry and voluntary codes that bridge the current gap. ",

It aims to build upon the important accounting concepts and principles including revenue recognition, inventory, depreciation, and understanding the accounting equation. The course focuses initially on how to record economic events in the accounting records (i.e., bookkeeping and accrual accounting) and how to prepare and interpret the primary financial statements that summarize a firm's economic transactions (i.e., the balance sheet, the income statement, and the statement of cash flows). The course adopts a decision-maker perspective of accounting by emphasizing the relation between accounting data and the underlying economic events that generated them thereby enabling the students to read, understand and analyse financial statements through ratio analysis. The course also explores the areas of financial shenanigans wherein the students will be able to learn how companies use financial statements to disguise economic reality.,",

In this sense, organisations are not merely seen as a place where communication happens, but it exists because employees communicate and create the sense in the existing structure. Also, the idea of the workplace has moved beyond the simple \"office space\" to \"living social networks\" that combine work, home and play. Moreover, organisations use their website and social media to communicate with internal and external stakeholders. Viewed, thus, in this context, the course looks at the constitutive view of communication and intends to familiarise students with workplace communications as practised in the corporate world. The course is interdisciplinary and involves the combination of concepts (communication, sociology and computer-mediated technology) into one project. ,",

The course covers three themes drawing high attention from the governments as well as other stakeholders including civil society and businesses. Conventionally the three themes; energy, environment and sustainability; are perceived through the lens of trade-offs. This perspective is changing in recent times. Policymakers, professionals and civil society actors are cooperating to align strategies and actions across themes to overcome societal and individual risks and to gain co-benefits and comparative advantage. In many environmentally proactive entities, \u201csustainability\u201d is a core issue that is increasingly integrated with organizational processes, systems and strategies. Delineation of policies to align energy, environment and sustainability is a highly explored subject drawing interest from researchers and practitioners. The course is divided into four modules which combine distinct yet inter-related concepts around the three central themes. The sessions cover the landscape ranging from global, national to local, spanning technologies, management and concepts from social sciences and ecology.\u00a0,",

Digital is no longer a grey area. It becomes inevitable that the brand language be effectively transformed from one media to another without changing the brand image. Throughout this course, the focus would be to expose students to ideas, applications, experiences and opportunities that are relevant to today\u2019s times. This course is primarily about creating visual artefacts that communicate effectively, but that does not mean you need to be an artist to succeed. Assessment will focus upon your efforts and your willingness to engage with your classmates to provide feedback and learn from one another. The more time you spend with the exercises in this course, the more skills you will develop as a visual communicator. Take the time to explore each exercise, take risks, and reiterate often. Don\u2019t allow your first attempt at any solution to be your only attempt. Fail early and fail often. Learning what doesn\u2019t work is an essential process in understanding what does work. This course is open for students who are admitted to any programme at the University.    ,",

The course will cover topics like Probabilistic Voting, Median Voter\u2019s Theorem, Downsian Model of Electoral Competition, politics of redistribution over pensions and unemployment insurance, politics of special interest over local public goods and lobbying, separation of power through political institutions, presidential versus parliamentary political regimes etc.  ,",

The course will largely focus on contemporary forms of social identification but present them as historically and culturally situated, and mediated by global flows. In particular, we will consider the contradictory effects of new technologies and markets for contemporary forms of social identification and inequality, and the utility of difference for accruing cultural capital in a market economy. Course content is drawn from a range of academic fields of inquiry including anthropology, sociology, literature and cultural studies.\u00a0,",

        "Description": "The city of Ahmedabad has been at the crossroads of major historical currents. A key commercial centre of western India, Ahmedabad was at the vanguard of industrialisation in modern India. Ahmedabad via the coastal port cities such as Surat was a gateway to the sea routes of the Indian Ocean via the Arabian Sea, home to influences from West Asia as well as peninsular South Asia. Although the city functioned as a political and administrative centre, it had a strong tradition of craft goods production, merchant entrepreneurship, and banking and financial services.\u00a0 It maintained thriving trade contacts with\u00a0 neighbouring towns and port cities as well as imperial centres at Delhi and Agra. In 1700 AD, Ahmedabad was, by some estimates, the sixth most populous city in the world[1]. Today, it continues as one of the most populous cities in India, a key node of national politics as well as business and urban development initiatives and emblematic of the opportunities and challenges before contemporary Indian society, wherein modernist development paradigms have been superimposed on traditional social structures.\u00a0The course will help students understand the city as an arena for economic activities (industry, trade and commerce, and informal work), merchant communities, entrepreneurship, city life and culture, and global engagement over the centuries. It will also examine the causes and consequences of conflicts over material and symbolic resources, which have been key to the social organisation of the city. It examines various efforts at urban development charting the city\u2019s built form for the future. Through a combination of lectures, classroom discussions, and projects the course encourages students to analyse these historical and contemporary processes in Ahmedabad in the wider historical context of Gujarat. Through these experiences, students will receive an introduction to disciplinary concepts and theories that will be built upon systematically by later courses in the student\u2019s chosen major.\u2018Ahmedabad as a Gateway to the World\u2019 is a mandatory course for all BA students majoring in History or SPS (Social and Political Sciences), and for all Integrated MBA students.

        "Description": "This course is the first of a set of two courses where students will learn scholastic Sanskrit through exercises drawn from various Sanskrit literary sources, such as well-known subh\u0101\u1e63itas, Pa\u00f1catantra, V\u0101lm\u012bki R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a, etc. In this course, students will be introduced gradually to various aspects of Sanskrit morphology and syntax so as to enable them to read simple Sanskrit sentences and verses. Exercises (sentences, verses and passages) for each class will be drawn from original Sanskrit works (brief description below), and will be chosen so as to exemplify the key grammatical features which need to be explained.            The Pa\u00f1catantra is a famous collection of Sanskrit stories, in verse and prose, dated to around the second/third century CE and is considered a n\u012bti\u015b\u0101stra (a treatise on government or political science). The V\u0101lm\u012bki R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a is one of the two famous Indian epics, a mammoth work comprising nearly 24,000 verses and which is of monumental importance and legacy.  Each class will be divided into three segments: a revision of the past lesson(s) (and review of assigned after-class exercises), the scheduled lesson, and in-class exercises taken from Sanskrit literature. There will also be surprise tests to further reinforce the learning of various grammatical features.   This course will prepare students to take the second of this set of courses, wherein students will study more advanced syntactical aspects of the language. These two courses will prepare students with the adequate training in Sanskrit grammar to begin their study of original Sanskrit works. Knowledge of the Devan\u0101gar\u012b script is not a prerequisite for this course.,",

The students will be introduced to the fundamental concepts, principles and theories in social psychology to then review these in light of the changing times that we live in. The course introduces the idea of social psychologies getting refracted in different social, political and cultural contexts as contrasted to a default universal social psychology. After setting the tone, the course discusses the research methods in social psychology critiquing some key studies as required, while also identifying the advances in social cognition through neuroscience research. The key elements of the study are individual cognition, affect and behavior in the implied and/or actual presence of others, interpersonal behavior- principles and theories therein, esp., focusing on pro-social behavior and aggression and group processes, where the key step level changes that happen in human behavior as a consequence of group affiliation. Throughout the course, applications in different contexts, with an interdisciplinary lens, are introduced and examined in detail.\u00a0,",

The process of designing and doing research is a mix of various elements including the world view and social location of the researcher (researcher positionality), the selection of what one wants to investigate (research problem/question), and how one goes about doing it (research methods). This introductory and project-based course will familiarize students with the philosophical underpinnings of research, and enable them to identify, compare and contrast different qualitative and quantitative research methods suitable for answering a question, apply their understanding to design a research project in small groups, collect and analyse data, and demonstrate basics of academic writing.,",

While drawing is often seen as a primary tool supporting creative research within art practice, this course will also consider drawing as an independent and intimate approach that offers a keen insight to both the creative process and one\u2019s emotional state. To that end, it is a studio-practice course aided by strong contextual studies that will enable students to develop basic rendering skills, understand drawing as a form of action and gesture that is an affirmation of life. Students will be able to objectively perceive the world we live in, which forms the crux of art-making in any art form \u2013 including printmaking, photography, painting, and digital art.",

Simultaneously, the course will introduce  theoretical approaches that define, delineate, and distinguish what makes us laugh, and why. The course will also explore ways in which comedy shapes culture and social discourse and how public discourses are reframed through social constructions of race, gender, class, caste, sexuality, disability etc. as framed in comedy.\u00a0,",

What are the promises, and perils, of political psychology that invites individual decision makers' lived experience to converse with, and contest, abstract disciplinary theories and categories? In this practice-intensive seminar, we explore political psychology and some quantitive methods with specific attention to their subvert, generated, evolved understandings of politics, power, and its dynamics. Readings draws on exemplary political psychologies as well as discussions of quantitive methods and methodologies in social science. Students will have the opportunity to redesign political psychology research projects related to students' own primary areas of interests and will be expected to make significantly weekly commitments to R programming practices. The seminar/hands-on workshop is intended as preparation for senior and junior students planning to conduct research for their undergraduate thesis, but those interested in a capstone project and the ontological, epistemological, political, and psychological implication of studying power from individuals are also welcomed.\u00a0,",

        "Description": "This course introduces students to caste as an analytical category in studying social and cultural processes. Making use of ethnographies, letters, memoirs, and autobiographies, students will engage writings on caste both as subject and method. What does it mean to write about caste in the contemporary? How do they inform one another? Rather than demonstrate a customary prevalence of caste in the present-day, the course explores the contours of contemporary theory the lens of caste. The experiential alongside anthropological modes of understanding serve as interrogative strands throughout the course. When it is not reduced to a singular concept around time, the contemporary becomes a unique vantage point to critically locate how we have come to inhabit the social and the ethical. Further, the course is designed to bring in global perspectives around caste and does not limit it to an isolated regional phenomenon.The course is valuable to students who are interested in questions around social hierarchy, ethics, and experience.,",

We begin with how animals learn and communicate with each other, then move on to discuss how they find food, avoid predators, choose their mates, and rear their offspring. This course is aimed at anyone looking to broaden their understanding of animal behaviour beyond nature documentaries or a typical high school education. No previous knowledge is required, only curiosity and enthusiasm for the subject.,",
