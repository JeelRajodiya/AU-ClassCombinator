An orientation and curiosity of studying Indian and global business history  Business history has an important role to play in developing and clarifying our understanding of the evolution of business – be it industries, individual companies, business families and groups amidst the social and economic environment in which it sustains. While quantitative methodologies and the need for big data drive research in Management studies, this course demonstrates how far business history is a truly global field, even while studying it from a national framework. To draw in-depth, fine-grained comparisons across different regions of the country, examining strategies of firms, states, and business associations, students stand to gain new perspectives into their own businesses while participating in current debates in adjacent fields such as political economy and global businesses.  This course on the history of Indian Business is multidisciplinary in its nature, where history and business are conjointly examined as important tools for understanding human nature and its past endeavors, throwing light on the present and future in many ways for the young managers/entrepreneurs.  By following a project based learning pedagogy, this course attempts at enabling students to understand history as contemporary, everyday lived experience., View/Print Outline

This is a seminar course to discuss scenarios of professional practice and ethical aspects in heritage management. This is designed specifically for the Heritage Management students, and is to be offered in the final semester of the programme. The idea behind this course is not to ‘teach’ a particular way of professional practice and or a set of ethics, but to make students aware of multiple fields of practice in different settings, and to sensitize them on potential roles, responsibilities, rights as well as ethical concerns that may come in such fields of practices – particularly keeping in mind their own scenarios or career plans as they graduate from the Masters degree in Heritage Management.Heritage is a broad concept connecting to various disciplines and almost all levels of society. Heritage Management is an evolving field of practice which aims to keep the heritage idea in focus while working in development, planning, economic activities, community development, research and institution building etc. Hence, there are multiple avenues of practice that the graduates of the Heritage management programme may pursue – from being an individual heritage professional to taking a leading position in a heritage related organization, from setting up their own entrepreneurial business to venturing into a large scale corporate type set up tapping into any sector of heritage, i.e. textile or metal work etc., from joining a government department to working in the NGO sector, from being an administrator in a local urban body to being an academician, and so on. Accordingly, it comes with its own complexities and potential conflicts of interests too. It is in such contexts that this course aims to highlight the potential overlaps, conflict of interests, individual and societal rights, organizational behavior and ethics etc. that may be relevant to heritage practitioners. This is not an exclusive course to cover all possible topics and areas – which perhaps is impossible, but this is a course to trigger such sensitivities in the minds of future heritage managers, and to enable them to explore such issues and be prepared to frame their career plan and professional activities in a more just and responsible ways., View/Print Outline

It is aimed at making designerly behaviour a very core mindset and bodyset.Design Thinking in the modern context is recognised as a core business activity which is capable of enhancing all activities around it, making them better and more human and consequently profitable as well. Over the years, it has developed as a very robust and ever-evolving combination of design, science, human behaviour and business principles. At the centre of this is the target user for whom systems are built to understand them, empathise with them define their problems and help them solve these problems through strategically targeted design interventions. Ultimately, all business is about the people who invest in it through one or the other level of consumer behaviour. Design Thinking is aimed at giving business thinkers, a very deeply strategic advantage in the market.The proposed course is an introduction to Design Thinking which is delivered through a set of 14 sessions, discussions, and structured assignments that help internalise these basic concepts. Several minor assignments and a major project serve as a vehicle for participative action that is central to the understanding of Design Thinking as applied to imaginative business models while understanding four key aspects – context, intent, recipients of the design and the system involved., View/Print Outline

Intellectual Property Right is an important part of organization strategy for organizations ranging from commercial companies to non-profits like education and research institutions. It is also important for individuals who create any original work, be it in the scientific, literary, or cultural domain. Intellectual property rights are considered monopolistic rights, but the monopoly is a limited one as the IPRs will go in the public domain after a certain stipulated time. The ethical implications of the IPRs will be discussed and deliberated during the course through various case studies where monopolistic presence versus the social benefits are in conflict especially pharmaceutical products and/or utilitarian goods. The course will familiarize students with the popular types of intellectual properties and the legal provisions related to them and the administrative remedies which can be sought for. With the advent of technology, intellectual property protection has become a challenge due to piracy. The course deals with the technological solutions to the sustainable inventions and whether they can be protected through IPRs or not he course also looks into the contemporary issues of Intellectual Property rights in the global context. The course will also provide insight into the competitive and strategic advantages of enterprises by using Intellectual Property Rights ., View/Print Outline

Success or failure of modern day businesses cannot be measured solely by the existence or adequacy of profits. The means of profit are as important as the profit itself. These businesses, which primarily operate for economic benefits of their owners, must also take into account the interests of other stakeholders. The course deals with ethical considerations and dilemmas that affect managerial decisions and equips the learners with methods to deal with such situations. The course is delivered in two parts; foundations of ethics and managerial dilemmas in operational areas. The first part introduces foundational concepts and theories of ethics that provide different perspectives to ethical concerns and dilemmas. The second half deals with specific ethical concerns arising in functional areas of management and ways to resolve these conflicts in managerial decision-making., View/Print Outline

Introduction to AI: A Management Perspective

Amit Das, Amit Singh
Winter
The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), inaugurated in a summer workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956, has seen many ups and downs. After two short-lived booms in the early eighties and the late nineties, AI has come into its own in the last decade, partly because data-driven machine learning has tackled a wider range of problems than earlier approaches based on search, logic, and (human) expert knowledge. After a brief introduction to other areas of AI – game-playing, symbolic reasoning, knowledge representation, and planning – our course will focus mostly on machine learning. Together, machine learning and traditional statistics constitute data science, with everyday uses such as e-mail spam filtering and handwriting recognition and business applications such as credit rating, bankruptcy prediction, customer churn modelling, and employee turnover analysis. Today’s business graduates must learn about these applications of AI (particularly machine learning) to remain competitive in the field of management. AI also attracts significant investment in the financial markets. Hence, a good understanding of the field is critical to making smart investments in information technology., View/Print Outline

The course aims at providing the theoretical models and practical tools that would enable cultural organisations to manage change, benefiting from some of the latest developments in the areas of business management, strategy and marketing.  In this context, the key challenges for cultural organisations are to: • be agile in the changing and fluid environment;  • achieve and sustain innovation over time; and  • maintain and increase their visitors and networks, securing financial viability and also contributing to the development of the local and the broader community.  A wide range of cultural organisations, international and Asian and Indian ones, from both the public and the private sector are used as case studies.

Does university policy on minimum class attendance improve student performance? Does girl education increase their marriage age and reduce fertility? Do new bank branches in villages increase women's entrepreneurship? Does a petrol price hike reduce private transportation usage?, Such cause-and-effect questions on “Does X cause Y, or is X just correlated with Y?” are very relevant and come up in discussions in our day-to-day lives. However, the appropriate answer to such questions is very policy-relevant. Therefore, it requires a good understanding of the difference between correlation and causality and the methods that help differentiate between the two ideas. This course is essentially about learning how to find appropriate answers to the above questions., In this course, students will learn the counterfactual model of causality, enabling them to identify the causal mechanisms that influence the relationship between two variables. For most of the course, students will receive an intuitive and theoretical understanding of the applied (microeconometric) research methods, followed by their applications through research papers and their practice in STATA. At the end of this course, students should be able to apply these methods to their research ideas and the corresponding data from any particular field of interest (development, education, health, labour, environment, finance, management, etc.)., View/Print Outline

Urban development and transport systems are strongly interconnected. Changes in one influence the other. The aim of this course is to look at these two sub-systems in unison. The course is therefore divided into two modules. The objectives of Module-1: Urban planning is to develop an understanding of the various theories of urban planning and design, introduce basic concepts of how cities develop, and the various approaches to planning and managing cities. Theories and models in urban planning and design would be covered followed by a discussion on alternative urban development approaches and formulation of urban and transport infrastructure policy, and a liberal planning framework.  The objective of Module-2: Urban transport is to introduce urban transport infrastructure planning, design, and management.  Public transport, which is instrumental in a city’s socioeconomic development, will be a key focus.  Various debates and topical issues surrounding urban planning and transport will be covered by critical review assignments., View/Print Outline

This introductory course introduces students to the methods of lab and field experiments and the behavioural principles and theories of human decision making. Against the backdrop of Neoclassical economics (specifically Expected Utility Theory), this course will discuss deviations from the standard concepts of individual preferences, beliefs, and decision-making processes. In doing so, we will see that people are loss-averse, present-biased, more social, and often use heuristics in their decision-making. Experimental evidence from education, labour, health, public economics/finance and development economics will elucidate these ideas.  More broadly, this course will provide students with an overview of how researchers and policymakers have leveraged their understanding of behavioural and experimental economics to study and find solutions to fix undesirable or less desirable individual decisions (from a social planner’s perspective). Considering that this is an introductory course, the theory and experiments will be discussed with a greater focus on intuition and a lesser emphasis on the technicalities. The mathematical technicalities, along with the fine details behind the design of an experiment, could be worked upon in a more advanced level course on experimental and/or behavioural economics., View/Print Outline

The course's overall aim is to improve participants' ability to identify, structure, and execute cooperative strategies. In the last 20 years, we have seen the rise of business and platform ecosystems that create value by connecting various actors. The largest transport company (Uber) does not own cabs. The largest hotel accommodation and hospitality provider (Airbnb) doesn't own hotels. Controversies regarding Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have shown the damage a mismanaged ecosystem can cause. Given the evolving landscape, it is likely that participants will either be part of or compete with a cooperative ecosystem in the future., Managers trying to understand these collaborative value creation activities face several issues ranging from identifying various actors, source of value creation, how to structure an ecosystem, how to capture value, and at the same time manage competition and cooperation. This course introduces participants to frameworks and tools to structure and find answers to these problems., It is ideal for Post-Graduate Students and 3rd or 4th Year Undergraduate Students across Management, Economics or Entrepreneurship, and Family Business Disciplines., The course is divided into four modules:, Module 1: Interdependence between organizations and actors, Sessions 2-6, Module 2: Cooperation and its implications, Sessions 7-12, Module 3: Coopetition, Sessions 14-17, Module 4: Cooperative strategies in action, Sessions 18-25, View/Print Outline

The central purpose behind this course is to acclimatize students to basics of corporate investments and value creation. To be specific, as part of this course, students would work towards garnering competency in applying time value of money techniques to arrive at valuation in different contexts, such as personal investments, valuation of financial instruments, and assessing viability of firm-level investments. Further, students would be introduced to different drivers of firm value. In doing so, students would be exposed to aspects such as capital budgeting, capital structure and working capital management. While the course per se would help the student navigate the different strands of financial management both at an individual level as well as at the firm level, such navigations are not only meant to build competency in individual strands, but also to help students attain an integrated perspective -one that is anchored on value creation., View/Print Outline

Living Heritage Approach and Sustainable Development

Heritage is not only about the past; heritage management is not only about preserving, and ‘freezing’, the past in the present. Heritage is also living, continuing and evolving into the present and the future; and heritage management is also about sustaining continuity and managing evolution., Within this framework, ‘living heritage approach’ (LHA) is an approach to heritage management that:, • sees heritage as part of the identity of the contemporary local communities;, • empowers local communities in the heritage management process, recognizing their traditional knowledge, management systems and maintenance practices; and, • links heritage management to sustainable development, by making heritage relevant to the socio-economic needs of the contemporary local communities., LHA could be considered an innovative approach in the sense that it is different from, and moves beyond, values-based approach – i.e. the current most preferred approach to heritage management, adopted, and advocated by major conservation authorities, both at national level (e.g., USA, Canada, Australia, and UK) and at international level (e.g., UNESCO World Heritage Centre), and by major research and educational institutions (e.g., the Getty)., LHA is of international scope, yet of particular relevance to the Asian and Oceanic and the Indian context, and specifically to the World Heritage City of Ahmedabad, respecting the local religious and cultural traditions and bringing significant benefits to the local communities., The course:, • presents the key characteristics and the planning process methodology for the application of the LHA;, • examines the application of the LHA in a wide range of heritage sites such as religious sites and historical towns and villages; and, • highlights the contribution of the LHA to reconciling development/energy infrastructure to heritage sites and local communities., A wide range of heritage sites, international and Asian-Oceanic and Indian ones, are used as case studies., The ultimate aim of the course is to help current and potential heritage managers understand the importance and develop methodologies of involving, and empowering, local community and civil society members in the heritage management process. Above all, the course encourages current and potential heritage managers to adopt a new ‘paradigm’ that would recognize the local communities as the long-term custodians of their heritage and themselves as the supporters and mediators – towards the continual creation of heritage in the present and the future., The course addresses undergraduate and postgraduate students interested in heritage sites (religious sites, historical towns and villages) and local communities, and in tourism., View/Print Outline

Brands exist in the consumers’ minds and yet entice them to act as if it were a relationship of the heart.Brands often look for top-of-mind recall, but branding is an emotional connection that the audience forms with the brand and its message thereby creating a loyal following. It is not what you think and says but what they (the audience) perceive and believe. Therefore, branding is a function of strategy and psychology that embeds various facets of design in it.This course is designed to cover the fundamentals of branding and packaging to sensitize you to the decision-making process required to create a cohesive brand language. In a world dominated by brands, it is important to understand the key differentiating factor and then build an experience around it. Strategic Packaging design directly contributes to building a brand image by functional or aesthetic elements or by reinforcement of brand image by giving out an experience. This course will offer the tools and techniques required to formulate the right strategy for success.The pedagogy consists of interactive sessions with a healthy mix of fundamental theory, case studies, on the spot, and group assignments for hands-on learning.Your key takeaway from this course will be the ability to make smart decisions for building a successful brand image and a long-term plan for a lasting brand impression., View/Print Outline

Nature is the best example of good design. Taking inspiration from nature has been an important part of human evolution. There are many examples of good designs which have been inspired by nature. Biomimicry is studying elements from nature: form, colour, function, movement, life cycle, growth, etc. and using it as an inspiration for designing products, spaces, visuals for communication, systems, etc.Today in our modern world and our way of life, we are moving away from our natural connection with nature. It is all the more critical that we study its various inspects to learn and use it as an inspiration for good design. The whole area of Biomimicry, Bionics, etc, has developed a lot and there is a lot more awareness about this field in current times. Toys are also recognized today as playing an important role in learning, development, building cultural connect and socio-emotional bonds and as part of the entertainment sector. Toys are a part of unstructured play and a means to create playful experiences.  In this course, we will study nature with a new perspective and explore possibilities of using it to ideate and design toys or playful elements., View/Print Outline

So, why do so many products and services fail to achieve this ideal? All products, whether digital or otherwise, must deliver a high-quality user experience or risk losing users to competitors.The focus of interaction design is on user-centred design based on the understanding of real users including their experiences, goals, needs, wants and tasks. The goal of interaction design is also to collect and analyse data to make informed interface design decisions which are critical to creating and delivering successful products, services and systems that fulfil the user/customer, technological and business needs., View/Print Outline

Why do business cycles occur? Does the COVID19 shock have a transitory or persistent effect on macroeconomic indicators like economic growth, unemployment, interest rates and inflation? How do institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund forecast growth rates of nations?, Such behaviour of economic as well as financial variables is studied in detail in time series econometrics. The above questions are a few examples in this regard. This course goes beyond the traditional use of time series analysis to forecast the time path of a variable. It is extremely relevant to decompose a series into deterministic and stochastic components for making forecasts, interpretation of economic data, drawing causal inferences and the direction of causality. The serial dependence structure demonstrates a difference equation with both deterministic and stochastic components, whose solution(s) yields a time path of a single series or a vector of many interdependent series., This advanced graduate course will familiarise students with modelling and forecasting of time series data. It will expose them to the basic techniques of time series econometric analyses and its applications in economics and finance.

This introductory course introduces students to the methods of lab and field experiments and the behavioural principles and theories of human decision making. Against the backdrop of Neoclassical Economics, this course will discuss deviations from the standard concepts of individual preferences, beliefs, and decision-making processes. In doing so, we will see that people are loss-averse, present-biased, more social, and often use heuristics in their decision-making. Experimental evidence from education, labour, health, public economics/finance and management will elucidate these ideas. Students will also learn to create and implement experiments using the open-source platform, oTree., More broadly, this course will provide students with an overview of how researchers and policymakers have leveraged their understanding of behavioural and experimental economics to improve economic, policy and management outcomes. Considering that this is an introductory course, the theory and experiments will be discussed with a greater focus on intuition and a lesser emphasis on the technicalities., View/Print Outline

Ethics, as an area of philosophical inquiry, deals with the question of how we ought to act in any given situation. In this introductory course, we will explore a set of influential contemporary moral theories, and learn how these can be applied to some of the most pressing moral issues of our time. We will address some aspects of the following questions. Is there a criterion for distinguishing between right and wrong? Are morals culturally relative? What is the best human life? What might be the moral bases for accepting or rejecting practices like euthanasia, abortion, affirmative action, and civil disobedience? To what extent are we obligated to assist people in need? How ought we to treat animals? What might an ethical relationship between nations look like? Finally, we will discuss a subset of key ethical issues relating to the fields of engineering, business, and bioethics., View/Print Outline

Does university policy on minimum class attendance improve student performance? Does girl education increase their marriage age and reduce fertility? Do new bank branches in villages increase women's entrepreneurship? Does a petrol price hike reduce private transportation usage?, Such cause-and-effect questions on “Does X cause Y, or is X just correlated with Y?” are very relevant and come up in discussions in our day-to-day lives. However, the appropriate answer to such questions is very policy-relevant. Therefore, it requires a good understanding of the difference between correlation and causality and the methods that help differentiate between the two ideas. This course is essentially about learning how to find appropriate answers to the above questions., In this course, students will learn the counterfactual model of causality, enabling them to identify the causal mechanisms that influence the relationship between two variables. For most of the course, students will receive an intuitive and theoretical understanding of the applied (microeconometric) research methods, followed by their applications through research papers and their practice in STATA. At the end of this course, students should be able to apply these methods to their research ideas and the corresponding data from any particular field of interest (development, education, health, labour, environment, finance, management, etc.)., View/Print Outline

The context of this course is the changing landscape of natural heritage global commons in the preceding 10 years. During  the past few years the concept of Global Commons has extended  from  Climate and Biodiversity to  include global peace, zoonotic global pandemics like  COVID 19, Arts and Heritage and  the global financial order. A classic case of the importance of global peace as a Global Commons is that of the volatile situation created by North Korea and the Russian invasion of Ukraine  which has had ramifications across the world by way of biodiversity loss, climate change, global recession, oil price hikes. The  importance of multilateral and bilateral negotiations to resolve these issues  has been crucial. Meanwhile international financing agencies such as the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, the European Investment Bank and the Global Environmental Facility have developed  portfolios on climate change and biodiversity by way of direct investments and transfer of new patented technologies in low carbon technologies. The other significant development has been the advent  of digital ledgers like Block chains and AI and the metaverse which have found applications in the management of these global commons., View/Print Outline

Facilitators: Professor Rakesh Basant, Ms Tanvi Rangwala, Associate Professor Fenil Shah and Professor Jayendra Bhalodiya., Innovation and entrepreneurship-related processes are multi-disciplinary in nature. Consequently, it is imperative that students acquire an integrated multi-disciplinary perspective on how technology applications(innovations) are designed, developed and commercialised. Innovation, Design and Business Models is a project-based interdisciplinary course for3rd and 4th year students of different Programme streams – engineering, management and Arts & Social Sciences. The endeavour is to expose students to a process of combining inputs from areas of business, design and technology in an integrated manner to address real-life problems through sustainable innovation-based solutions. The projects undertaken by student teams will explore the application of emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in sectors likeEnvironment, Fintech and Healthcare. The course will allow the students to blend different disciplines into a cohesive whole to obtain a nuanced understanding of the conceptual underpinnings and practical issues relating to technology-based solutions for real-world business or societal problems., The course will be offered to 30 students of different backgrounds. We propose to form 10 teams of three members, and each team will consist of students from engineering, management and arts & sciences Programmes.Efforts will also be made to ensure that each team has a member who has done courses in design (DES202 or DES203). It is hoped that the team members will build on the learnings from earlier courses and experiences., The students in the course would be expected to undertake the following tasks:, 1. Work as a part of a multi-disciplinary team to identify a set (~5) of potential applications of AI/ML technologies in healthcare or fintech to address real-world problems. The teams would be expected to briefly describe the problems these applications are addressing and provide critical elements of the technology solution.2. Pick one of the problems mentioned above/solutions for an in-depth interdisciplinary analysis. The reasons for choosing one of the five should also be described briefly. (Identifying the ‘best’ application from the list suggested by the teams will also provide learning opportunities. This process will be facilitated by facilitators/anchors involved in the course).3. Design and develop a medium-fidelity prototype for the selected application. (The nature of the prototype would vary depending on the chosen application).4. Develop a detailed business model/plan for the selected application., View/Print Outline

This will be an industry awareness course to help students get familiar with the venture capital and private equity modes of investments. The intent is to get the perspective of the investor in this space and learn how these investment firms are structured and what their business models are. They will learn the basics of due diligence, valuation and deal structuring. The students will learn about team building, effective communication and negotiation with internal and external stakeholders through case study assignments. They will learn how to make a pitch on behalf of a startup as well as how to evaluate a pitch on behalf of the investors by participating in classroom case study exercises., India is witnessing a boom in investments by venture capital and private equity firms post COVID in terms of doubling of investment teams by top funds in 2019-2023 period (Bain & Company’s Global Private Equity Report, 2024). The first half of 2024 has shown a clear trend towards hiring in key areas that support technology, operational efficiency, ESG initiatives, healthcare innovation and financial strategy, as per a study by Prequin (Prequin Private Capital Compensation and Employment Review 2024 by Ferguson Partners) shows that 54% of private equity firms plan to increase the hiring of finance professionals in 2024 to support their growth and expansion strategies. It is desirable for the MBA and MSQF students to have an exposure to the Private Equity industry., In the Indian context, in the recent years the relevance of small and medium enterprises for development has become particularly noteworthy. As these firms are more constrained than large firms in terms of access to financial capital, venture capital and private equity play a vital role in constituting a valuable resource for a firm’s growth, especially for the more innovative SMEs, so that they can support economic development and innovation in the economy. Private Equity is considered an important element of a good entrepreneurial eco-system and a critical source of finance for start-ups, growing companies and for takeover transactions, View/Print Outline

This course is an introduction to the basic concepts and standards underlying the financial accounting systems. It aims to build upon the important accounting concepts and principles including revenue recognition, inventory, depreciation, and understanding the accounting equation.

In academic institutions focusing upon management, commerce and technology, discussions of ‘culture’ are rare. Very occasionally when ‘culture’ does figure, it has a designated space, isolated from the everyday permeation of culture in just about everything we see or do. Through a series of illustrations from media, art, rituals on one hand and ordinary situations when the ‘cultural’ asserts itself both overtly and covertly, on the other hand, the course hopes to make students aware of every situation that has a cultural dimension even when we least expect it to be., View/Print Outline

COM101 Effective Reading and Comprehension Skills
Organizations are seen as communicative structures where communication constitutes routine job activities. In this sense, organisations are not merely seen as a place where communication happens, but it exists because employees communicate and create the sense in the existing structure. Also, the idea of the workplace has moved beyond the simple "office space" to "living social networks" that combine work, home and play. Moreover, organisations use their website and social media to communicate with internal and external stakeholders. Viewed, thus, in this context, the course looks at the constitutive view of communication and intends to familiarise students with workplace communications as practised in the corporate world. The course is interdisciplinary and involves the combination of concepts (communication, sociology and computer-mediated technology) into one project., View/Print Outline

The central intent behind this course is to sensitize students to the different kinds of risks faced by market participants and how derivative instruments could be used to mitigate (if not completely eliminate) such risks. In doing so, students are introduced to the different types of derivatives instruments that are available in the market place, their utility, and the attendant market structures and price mechanisms pertaining to such derivative instruments. Further, students are exposed to pertinent risk management strategies that can be undertaken by market participants at different levels of the value chain so as to mitigate different risks. 																	 The 1991 big bang reforms in general and the financial sector reforms in particular, among many things, led to the establishment of cutting-edge state-of-the-art institutions such as National Stock Exchange (NSE) and National Securities Clearing Corporation Limited (NSCCL; now renamed as NSE Clearing Limited.), which in turn have played an instrumental role in development of vibrant derivatives market in India. This has catapulted India in global league when it comes to derivatives trading activity. Consequently, this course is also geared to making students appreciate the opportunities and challenges with respect to Indian derivative markets, without losing sight of the regulatory actions that have enabled the prevalence of derivatives market in the first place., View/Print Outline

In the contemporary age of increasing integration among the economies of the world, questions such as why and how countries trade with one another, how international capital flows are decided, how do indigenous firms compete against the mighty multinational corporations, the relevance of interest and inflation rate differentials, how the international value of currency gets decided, and many more, call for the attention of students of Economics. Answers to these questions are not simple, and there scarcely exists a unique solution for any one of them. Nevertheless, principles of Economics, both Micro and Macro, often provide an interesting and effective framework on which the logic of international economic issues can be constructed.  																																					 														         International Economics provides an insight into some of these principles and equips undergraduate students in the field of management with the understanding of the functioning of the economies in a globalized world.

Energy companies are among the fastest-growing companies, both in terms of revenue and prots. In India, ve of the top fifteen companies are in the business of energy exploration, production and/or distribution. Apart from the conventional energy businesses, new avenues have also opened up in fields of alternative energy supply, smart grids and energy services. 																 																 																																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        Energy businesses are facing unprecedented challenges. While the demand for energy is on the rise, conventional fossil fuel stocks are uncertain and depleting, there is a global imperative to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases. Since energy businesses often transcend national borders, they are exposed to global geopolitical, financial, and environmental market risks., View/Print Outline

Interdisciplinary Approach To Consumer Understanding

Ravi Miglani
Winter
[ Students for this course should be familiar with the basic principles of marketing and marketing research ]
This course will help students understand consumers at a deeper level, using interdisciplinary concepts and methods. 																																					 														        Understanding consumer behaviour needs an interdisciplinary approach – concepts and methods from several disciplines like neuromarketing, cognitive psychology, behavioural economics, anthropology, sociology, and more. Consumers often make irrational choices. Decisions are based on emotions and unconscious motivations – not only on rational logic. Consumer choices are implicit not explicit. Consumers cannot often express their motivations in response to traditional marketing research surveys. This is because consumers either won’t say why they made some choices (as the answers might not sound logical and reasonable) or they can’t say (as choices were made at an unconscious level and they themselves do not know why they choose a brand). The course will draw on the works of several neuroscientists and behavioural economists like Daniel Kahneman, Richard Thaler, and Dan Ariely. We will use behavioural economics experiments (‘Nudge’ as Richard Thaler calls it) to see how subtle interventions influence brand choices. We will explore how ethnography – a method of immersing oneself in consumer lives (used in anthropology and sociology) – can help us get under the skin of the consumer and observe the role of products and brands in consumer life, as lived and not as claimed in surveys., View/Print Outline

Visual/Creative communication in the digital age requires familiarisation and literacy that goes way beyond – beyond traditional practices. Digital is no longer a grey area. It becomes inevitable that the brand language be effectively transformed from one media to another without changing the brand image. Throughout this course, the focus would be to expose students to ideas, applications, experiences and opportunities that are relevant to today’s times. This course is primarily about creating visual artefacts that communicate effectively, but that does not mean you need to be an artist to succeed. Assessment will focus upon your efforts and your willingness to engage with your classmates to provide feedback and learn from one another. The more time you spend with the exercises in this course, the more skills you will develop as a visual communicator. Take the time to explore each exercise, take risks, and reiterate often. Don’t allow your first attempt at any solution to be your only attempt. Fail early and fail often. Learning what doesn’t work is an essential process in understanding what does work.

India has the fastest growing (9.2 percent in 2015-16) service sector in the world contributing about 66 percent to the Indian GDP. Operational excellence is critical for success in many service industries today, global competition and rapidly evolving information technology. However, understanding service operations is not easy. Services are intangible, highly variable, not storable or transportable and often involve distributed operations with a significant amount of customer contact. This means that most service operations look quite different than manufacturing operations, and they often require specialized analytical frameworks and tools., View/Print Outline

Why do business cycles occur? Does the COVID19 shock have a transitory or persistent effect on macroeconomic indicators like economic growth, unemployment, interest rates and inflation? How do institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund forecast growth rates of nations?Such behaviour of economic as well as financial variables is studied in detail in time series econometrics. The above questions are a few examples in this regard. This course goes beyond the traditional use of time series analysis to forecast the time path of a variable. It is extremely relevant to decompose a series into deterministic and stochastic components for making forecasts, interpretation of economic data, drawing causal inferences and the direction of causality. The serial dependence structure demonstrates a difference equation with both deterministic and stochastic components, whose solution(s) yields a time path of a single series or a vector of many interdependent series.This advanced undergraduate course will familiarise students with modelling and forecasting of time series data. It will expose them to the basic techniques of time series econometric analyses and its applications in economics and nance. The course is designed to provide hands-on training in econometric software(s) such as R, which is an open source free software to critically analyse and investigate pertinent empirical questions in the real world., View/Print Outline

Keita Omi
Winter
This course will serve as a major elective for the Social and Political Sciences (SPS) major and as a free elective or General Education Requirements (GER) for students from across the university. The purpose of this course is twofold: First, for you to master a certain set of conceptual tools and basic knowledge about comparative politics. Second, for you to formulate your own arguments about issues related to comparative politics, making use of these analytical tools and knowledge to develop and present your ideas. Hence, analytical thinking including creative and critical thinking is the most important ability which will be fully developed throughout this course. Yet, no prior knowledge on the subject is assumed nor required. The purpose of this class is to foster you to become a politically literate fledged graduate by highlighting diverse philosophic foundations of comparative politics and introducing broad and alternative methods of inquiring the study of comparative politics. Comprehension and willingness to learn basic political science approaches are needed., View/Print Outline

Winter
[ Students should ideally have completed a course in the Divisions of Humanities and Languages or Social Sciences ]
This course introduces students to some of the most influential theories and philosophies that have informed the study and writing of history. Students will learn a variety of theoretical and historical perspectives for viewing the world and thinking about historical studies, in general., Students will explore the development of historical understanding and the various problems and approaches to the study of history. Student will read, discuss, and write about some of the most important works of theory and historiography. As E.H. Carr tells us, “interpretation enters into every fact of history.” Yet, historians often disagree about those interpretations. Through this course, students will recognize the ways in which those disagreements are often rooted in conflicting perspectives about the nature of reality, forms of power, human nature, and truth., We discuss a different theme each week including post-colonialism, gender, memory, and ‘universal’ history; and engage with major thinkers such as Hegel and Marx., Normally, the class reads one essay per session in order to give it close attention, but longer essays may be spread across two class meetings. A typical class meeting consists of a lecture, reading together as a class, and discussion. Students should expect to read 30-40 pages per week., View/Print Outline

This course on brain and behaviour is primarily aimed at satisfying a core requirement for the psychology programme. This is the biological psychology core. It is aimed at second-year students who have no biology background beyond basic school biology. The required background will be provided as additional study material in the first two weeks of class. While psychology students are the main audience, the course serves as an introduction to neuroscience for the non-biologist and biologist alike. Thus, it is offered through the biological and life sciences programme, and will additionally serve as a campus-wide general education requirement (GER) in biology., Brain and Behaviour explores the physiological basis for psychological processes. Broadly this is the link between brain (the biological substrate) and certain functions of the brain. The course will cover innate and motivated behaviours, including sensation, motion, reproductive behaviours, perception, emotions, cognition, learning, memory, and language. Although our focus will be the “human brain” other species, especially rodents and non-human primates, will be considered for comparison. The course will provide enough knowledge of biological mechanisms, with an emphasis on neural and endocrine function, as they apply to psychology and the mind-brain connection. Through this understanding, and through an understanding of various imbalances in physiology, genetics, and biological development, students will gain an understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying normal behaviour and some of its abnormalities., View/Print Outline

This ENABLE course is a Major Elective for the SPS students., Cities are where future challenges lie, making them sites for various interdisciplinary investigations as well as solutions for human wellbeing and environmental sustainability. Today, more than half the world population lives in cities, creating the need for grounding of all social sciences, physical sciences, and professional works within the cities. Cities are spaces of opportunities as well as challenges given that there is no turning back the clock of history. Grounded within the Indian context, this course is divided into three broad segments that: one introduces students to important concepts and frameworks through which to understand various facets of a city; two introduces the challenges facing contemporary Indian cities and three unpack these challenges from the vantage of specific groups in the cities so as to move towards initial solutions. The challenges are presented through case studies and are related to the everyday living of urban residents with respect to employment and poverty, health, infrastructure, housing, ecology and pollution, climate change impacts, crime and violence and inequality., The course attempts to sensitise students to these challenges experienced by different populations in a city and solutions they bring on board. The sequel to this course would be towards systemic as well as decentralised solutions within the domains of urban planning and governance.  This course and its sequel will be of interest to the students thinking of future careers in urban management, urban and/ or development policies, climate change solutions, public health, media and social work sector., View/Print Outline

Mona Mehta
Winter
This course introduces students to the fundamental concepts of state and society as they are understood in the social sciences and explores their mutual relationships. How have classical theories conceptualised the state and society? How is the historical evolution of the state and society in the West different from the way they have evolved in the Global South, especially in India? The big transformations in information technology and capitalism in the 21st century have fundamentally impacted the state and social interactions. Through a focus on theory and empirical studies, the course explores five key themes or dimensions of the state-society interaction: 1. What is the state?; 2. What is society?; 3. Civil Society, social movements and citizenship; 4. Sociality and politics in the age of internet; 5. State, market society and neoliberalism.   The course will explore the following questions pertaining to its five themes: 1.	What are the important theoretical perspectives about the state (Weberian and Marxist)? How is the state experienced in the everyday lives of people in India?  2.	What does social theory tell us about the fundamental elements of society and social life (Emile Durkheim)? What are the dominant features of pre and post-independent Indian society? 3.	What is civil society and does it always strengthen democracy? How do social movements challenge the existing status quo of the state and society and when do they fail to do so?  4.	How has digital media technology transformed classical notions of the public sphere and what are its implications for social relations and harmony?   5.	What is market society and how has market thinking permeated social lives? What is the history and rise of neoliberalism and why is it best understood as a political project?, View/Print Outline

The course titled ‘Social Psychology’ is a core course towards a major in Psychology. The students will be introduced to the fundamental concepts, principles and theories in social psychology to then review these in light of the changing times that we live in. The course introduces the idea of social psychologies getting refracted in different social, political and cultural contexts as contrasted to a default universal social psychology. After setting the tone, the course discusses the research methods in social psychology critiquing some key studies as required, while also identifying the advances in social cognition through neuroscience research. The key elements of the study are individual cognition, affect and behavior in the implied and/or actual presence of others, interpersonal behavior- principles and theories therein, esp., focusing on pro-social behavior and aggression and group processes, where the key step level changes that happen in human behavior as a consequence of group affiliation. Throughout the course, applications in different contexts, with an interdisciplinary lens, are introduced and examined in detail., View/Print Outline

“North-Eastern culture is the jewel of Indian culture says Amit Shah, Union Home Minister.” “Volkswagen tries to change workplace culture that fueled emissions scandal.” “The world has seen a growth in cultural intolerance in the past few years.” Culture, a word familiar to most people, is used in myriad ways in everyday language. But what is culture? Where do we find it? And what roles does it play in society?Culture—referring broadly to shared meanings and behaviours among groups of people—has been a central concept in several disciplines in the Social Sciences and Humanities. ‘Culture’ and ‘cultural’ have functioned as objects of study as well as lenses for illuminating social, political and economic phenomena. This course will introduce students to selected approaches towards culture and frameworks for its analysis in Sociology, Anthropology and Cultural Studies., View/Print Outline

[ Although it is offered as a Core Course for History Major, the course may be of interest for students doing Majors in Political Science, Economics, and Management Studies. ]
This undergraduate course is a survey of empire in Indian history. It focuses on the historical experiences of empire, the self-image and ideologies of the political elites, and their dealings with the diverse groups of people and the local-level power holding communities. How did the entanglements between ruling elites and subject population help Indians to imagine themselves and their position in the world? The course further discusses the territory, trade routes, taxation or resource extraction, and redistribution. Furthermore, what role did the natural environment, political culture and institutions, and different communities play in the emergence and the functioning of empire? Finally, it asks how Indian society has been shaped by the collective memories and legacies of empire. Introducing the substrata of India’s political and economic past, it discusses key themes around the state formation and empire building processes.  																																					 														         The term empire acquired a negative connotation thanks to the British colonial high-handedness and the bitter experiences of decolonisation movements. However, the empire that Indians knew, lived in and experienced was not necessarily bad. For a long span of time, over the last two millennia, Indians lived and worked within one or the other empire. Compared with the long history of empire, the modern nation state is new. It is an adapted concept from nineteenth-century Europe. In several respects, the nation state appears to be lacking in meeting the demands of a “civilisation-state” i.e. India with its enormous diversity.  Discussion of empire and institutions can help form a more nuanced understanding the contemporary Indian society., View/Print Outline

This course introduces students to one of the ways in which we acquire knowledge about the world—Doing Research. Research is an attempt to understand the world through systematic study—that is, through identification of a problem, question, or hypothesis; selection of methods to investigate the question, collecting data, interpreting data, and reporting findings. The process of designing and doing research is a mix of various elements including the world view and social location of the researcher (researcher positionality), the selection of what one wants to investigate (research problem/question), and how one goes about doing it (research methods). This introductory and project-based course will familiarize students with the philosophical underpinnings of research, and enable them to identify, compare and contrast different qualitative and quantitative research methods suitable for answering a question, apply their understanding to design a research project in small groups, collect and analyse data, and demonstrate basics of academic writing., View/Print Outline

History of the 'Social

SPS301 History of the ‘Social’ is a core course for SPS Major, and can also be counted towards a minor in SPS. Although the course is located within SPS, it will also be of interest to students in PHL, and other majors, as it broadly deals with the making and applicability of concepts.       The course invites students from different disciplines to engage with the project of turning the ‘social’ into an object of inquiry. Building on the sense that though freely used in everyday life the word ‘social’ is little understood, the course will enable students to ask what makes a phenomena, a process, an event or a form of knowledge ‘social’. They will be able to ask and address questions such as, Do only human beings have society? How does one theorise something that is seemingly so near to us? And, why to theorise it in the first place? What is theory? Etc.       The course will open up these possibilities by introducing students to the various ways in which the ‘social’ has been broached and understood, particularly in the domain of inquiry we refer to as social theory. Students will learn to evaluate and apply theoretical perspectives to the world around them, and to appreciate both the possibilities and limitations of theorising as a way of understanding. The course has been designed in a way that students get a sense of the ‘social’ as a problem and not just as an abstract concept. They will get to see how various forms of social explanation developed in response to specific problems, and hence, how to assess them accordingly. The tensions and possibilities residing in each approach to the ‘social’ will be laid bare, enabling students to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each. They will be able to critically assess which of these approaches suits their own research interests best, and to use it productively and with awareness.       It is a reading intensive course and students will be expected to consistently work on challenging texts by major social theorists, anthropologists and historians. A typical class meeting will consist of lecturing, reading together as a class and discussion., View/Print Outline

Positive psychology is offered as a major elective course for students choosing to major in psychology. It can be chosen by all students, who are able to complete the prerequisites. Positive Psychology is the scientific enquiry of aspects of human experience which create and cultivate  joy and well-being. This growing and much delayed field of psychology exerts a very strong influence on several applied fields of psychology, which traditionally have been focused on what is ‘wrong’ with human experience. The present course will introduce the theory and practice of positive psychology which includes philosophical foundations of positive psychology, understandings of positive strengths and virtues, well-being through life span and applications. Alongside learning the theoretical concepts, the students will also have the opportunity to work through one’s own strengths through group projects. The course is designed with an applied orientation in intersections with health, clinical, counselling and sports psychology., View/Print Outline

SAN201 Reading Sanskrit Scholastic Texts: Elementary
This course is the second of a set of two courses (other being SAN201) which initiates students into the discipline of reading original Sanskrit texts. Students have been introduced to the intricacies of Sanskrit morphology and syntax in SAN101 and SAN102, and students began to read original, albeit relatively simpler, texts in SAN201. This course SAN202 concludes two years of Sanskrit study at the University, and thereby aims to bring students to a level where they will be self-sufficient in being able to continue their journey in the vast world of classical Sanskrit poetry and prose., In this course, students will read some important sections from any distinguished literary works. This will be decided by the instructor, and could be a literary text such as Kālidāsa’s Raghuvaṃśa and Bhartṛhari’s Nītiśataka or a philosophical work like Śaṅkarācārya's commentary on the Īśopaniṣad. (The Raghuvaṃśa is traditionally identified as one of the five mahākāvyas of Sanskrit literature and narrates the stories of kings belonging to the Raghu dynasty. The Nītiśataka is one of the three śatakas (centuries of verses) composed by the scholar-king Bharṭrhari, dealing primarily with ethics and morality. The Iśopaniṣad is considered as among the earliest Upaniṣads and Śaṅkarācārya's commentary is extremely influential for the philosophical school of Advaita Vedānta.)In their previous study, students have been introduced to the importance of Sanskrit commentaries and they will refer to requisite commentaries in this course. Students will also be introduced to the styles, meters and peculiar syntactical forms found in such Sanskrit literary texts. This course seeks also to reinforce another important aim – to contrast some English translations of these influential works with the original Sanskrit text, thereby demonstrating to students the inevitable gap in any work of translation (and the consequent intellectual joy in being able to read the original!)., View/Print Outline

Theatre has evolved through time as an important tool of expression and communication.  It is not only a source of entertainment but can serve as a catalyst for social reform or development. Theatre also expands our connection to the larger world around us, and our empathy for lives lived differently from our own. A director or an actor thinks from the perspective of the diverse characters they portray, improving tolerance towards others in the society. The audience, in turn, becomes witness to worlds that they might otherwise not encounter or be familiar with. Studies have also shown that students who participate in theatre perform better in academics as it enhances their power to express themselves.This course aims to introduce students to the different forms and functions of theatre, inclusive of the wide range of roles theatre practitioners can take on, such as directing, acting and scriptwriting.  We will also simultaneously discuss how theatre relates to societal concerns, using theatre games to help students to find present day issues that are relevant to them. Importantly, we will work together on producing skits and script writing in peer groups to encourage students to work cohesively in groups, overcome their inhibitions and find the confidence to engage in creative self-expression.This course is at beginner level & doesn’t require prior theatre experience. It is open to all students at the University. It will run for  one session a week (for 3 hours) as in a lab course. It is offered by Kabir Thakore, the Director of the Scrapyard Theatre in Ahmedabad., View/Print Outline

This course delves into the formation of the modern Hindi imagination through the influential works of Premchand, one of the most significant writers in Hindi and Urdu literature. His writings shaped the literary landscape of the Hindi-Urdu-speaking world and encapsulated the evolving hopes, struggles, and social consciousness of his time. By engaging with his works, students will explore how Premchand's storytelling contributed to the broader cultural and intellectual fabric of Hindi-speaking society.The course will approach Premchand's literature through two critical frameworks. The first will contextualize his work within the historical backdrop of the Indian national movement, with a particular emphasis on Gandhi's Hindustani ideals and the socio-political currents of the time. The second framework will bring Premchand's reflections on pressing issues such as caste, class, gender, communalism, and nationalism into dialogue with contemporary debates, highlighting the enduring relevance of his literary contributions.Premchand's ability to straddle the worlds of both Hindi and Urdu literature makes him a vital figure for understanding the composite culture of North India. By examining his work, students will gain new perspectives on the historical roots of today's social issues and the role of literature in shaping collective imagination., View/Print Outline

Thinking and Reasoning is an elective course for BA Psychology majors and is mainly (but not exclusively) aimed at BA Psychology students. Also, any student who is interested in the psychology of thinking and reasoning (and fulfilled the prerequisite of Introduction to Psychology) can opt for this course., The capacities of thinking and reasoning set humans apart from all other living beings. Because of these capacities humans can imagine and make inferences not just about the perceived entities and events but also about the non-existent constructs. This course discusses the nature of the fundamental psychological processes behind human intellectual feats such as conceptual representation, imagination, moral reasoning, religious thinking, rational analysis, scientific thinking, etc., However, it should be clarified that this course is distinct from other courses like critical thinking and logical reasoning; Critical thinking and logical reasoning courses are concerned with “how ought one reason well” ―i.e., they have the normative concern― while this course is mainly concerned with “how do humans actually think and reason” ―i.e., it focuses on the descriptive concern― and thus discusses the psychological dynamics of thinking and reasoning along with the cognitive biases and errors that humans exhibit., Though the primary objective of this course is to introduce the psychological processes involved in thinking and reasoning, the course will also cover various theoretical assumptions as well as the empirical findings pertaining to thinking and reasoning. Although this course mainly has a descriptive concern, the relevance and the practical applications of the theories and findings of the psychology of thinking and reasoning (as well as the remedies for the errors and biases in thinking and reasoning) will be discussed throughout the course., View/Print Outline

“Believing is seeing” is the Apple catchphrase to introduce its Pro Display XDR on the website. Only when one scrolls down can they know the technical details and the design that are ultimately there to promise a high-end visual experience. Apple is only one of many examples where visual experiences occupy a central position in understanding the contemporary and how that informs one’s relationship with history and the past. These instances demonstrate that visual experiences are powerful mediators in a modern world where the clinical faculty of human vision assumes one of the central sensory responses. Indeed, seeing shapes what one believes about the world around and the ideologies structuring belief systems., Through intensive hands-on analyses of selected themes and specific visual forms, this course will look into how visual arts shape modern South Asian experiences and craft one’s understanding of their contemporary and their past. It will discuss how visual art forms encode social norms and practices and embody myriad ways of seeing. The pedagogy and class discussions will revolve around the following key issues: What are the objects and sites through which unfolding stories of visual forms may be tracked? Why are artistic practices integral to addressing imperial, colonial, and postcolonial experiences? How do art forms forge community identities in the region, and what are their political implications? Do visual arts practices in modern South Asia belong to a fixed geographical and cultural landscape? Or does thinking about them entail thinking about shifting geopolitical and cultural boundaries?, These concerns will be addressed by closely experiencing specific media and material objects and their layered narratives. Students will have the opportunity of studying images and objects closely in museum and gallery spaces and appreciate their material, texture, colour and scale, which are often lost in digital projections in the classroom. Simultaneously, the course will weave together abstract thinking with historically and anthropologically grounded scholarship to train students not to see visual arts as naïve forms; students will learn to analyse formal structures and social histories and how visual imageries structure one’s historical consciousness., View/Print Outline

The sensory system is continuously receiving a large amount of information from the environment. To optimally process and interpret this information we must prioritize relevant inputs and suppress distracting inputs. Attention refers to the host of mechanisms that implements this selective tuning of sensory inputs. The course deals with various mechanisms that implement the function of selective attention with a focus on recent theoretical developments, empirical findings and real-world applications. The course covers classical ideas about attention as well as new research developments. The course is structured around four themes, starting with the discussion on classical findings and their relevance to real-life situations such as driving, marketing and interface design. Then the course delves deeper into the perceptual and cognitive processes modulated by attention and its physiological underpinnings.

Beginning with the supposed authenticity of photographs in objective visualization of events and the everyday, this course will explore the myriad ways in which meanings emerge from encounters between photographs and their beholders. These meanings are often contingent on the physical spaces and forms in which photographs meet their audiences. A single photographic image-object may acquire multiple meanings depending on its viewing location and its material form while also shaping the scope of those locations and materials. Closely analysing a wide range of photographs of events and the everyday from across cultures, this course targets to disentangle the analytical challenges posed by photographs’ materiality and their fluidity of meaning., View/Print Outline

The course is designed to study the construction of a human figure in visual arts, specifically in drawing and painting. Through focus on concepts of ‘contour’, ‘gesture’ and ‘structure’, students will learn how to draw a human figure both from direct observation and from memory, while also understanding the significance of a human figure in the global history of art through intellectual discourse. Students will learn to render a human figure through in-depth study of skeletal structure and muscles by using mediums including graphite, charcoal and paint (acrylic) and also paper and canvas as support., Beginning with simple gestural drawings, the course will help students understand how one or more human figures work in a composition, while also exploring descriptive poses, moving action, and group poses. The studio sessions will be spent making drawings of human figures from direct observation, and reference images including images captured by students and artworks by master artists. The reference artworks by master artists will include the ones who drew and painted in a classical style and the ones who explored human figure beyond the conventions of traditional style and ventured into abstraction., There will be ongoing guidance and critique of works-in-progress, and discussions of finished works, which will touch upon concepts crucial to the creative process, including emphasis on hand-eye coordination, critical thinking, and spontaneity. This will also be supplemented with museum and gallery visits in Ahmedabad., Sketchbooks will be an important component in this course; students will explore self-expression and alternative drawing methods as a part of their required initiative., View/Print Outline

But what is culture? Where do we find it? And what roles does it play in society?Culture—referring broadly to shared meanings and behaviours among groups of people—has been a central concept in several disciplines in the Social Sciences and Humani@es. ‘Culture’ and ‘cultural’ have func@oned as objects of study as well as lenses for illumina@ng social, poli@cal and economic phenomena.

History of the Social

The course invites students from different disciplines to engage with the project of turning the ‘social’ into an object of inquiry. Building on the sense that though freely used in everyday life the word ‘social’ is little understood, the course will enable students to ask what makes a phenomena, a process, an event or a form of knowledge ‘social’. They will be able to ask and address questions such as, Do only human beings have society? How does one theorise something that is seemingly so near to us? And, why to theorise it in the first place? What is theory? Etc.    The course will open up these possibilities by introducing students to the various ways in which the ‘social’ has been broached and understood, particularly in the domain of inquiry we refer to as social theory. Students will learn to evaluate and apply theoretical perspectives to the world around them, and to appreciate both the possibilities and limitations of theorising as a way of understanding. The course has been designed in a way that students get a sense of the ‘social’ as a problem and not just as an abstract concept. They will get to see how various forms of social explanation developed in response to specific problems, and hence, how to assess them accordingly. The tensions and possibilities residing in each approach to the ‘social’ will be laid bare, enabling students to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each. They will be able to critically assess which of these approaches suits their own research interests best, and to use it productively and with awareness.    It is a reading intensive course and students will be expected to consistently work on challenging texts by major social theorists, anthropologists and historians. A typical class meeting will consist of lecturing, reading together as a class and discussion., View/Print Outline

The Sweep of History

History is more than a list of facts, names, dates, and places. It is a complex set of variables, causalities, decisions, relationships, and improbable coincidences.The Sweep of History aims to introduce students to at least 13.8 billion years of history and think about the future through the course of 25 moments in time and space, beginning with the Big Bang and ending with a contemplation of the death of the world as we know it. The overarching theme may seem to be inevitable human progress and an increasingly globalized world, but we’ll see that this is only one narrative among many others. Likewise, the only actors in this drama may seem to be humans, but we’ll also try to think about the role of Nature in history.The Sweep of History is not intended to be a comprehensive history of everything. Rather think of this as a process of discovery as we explore various themes. But this also as an introduction into history as a discipline. You will explore the methods of the historian: how does the historian grapple with their position in time and in the world? How does the historian reconstruct the past? How does the historian narrate the past (and think about the present and the future)? The assignments and final project will allow you to experience first hand what it means to do history., View/Print Outline

The course will introduce the students towards principles of doing systematic investigation on a scientific problem, and will demonstrate the ways to interpret the findings to derive robust conclusions. ‘Doing research’ is conceptually different from ‘reading/understanding research’. The course attempts to dwell on both parts, as the latter is important in initiating, and refining the other part. The course will start from explaining what is research, the several steps involved in doing scientific research starting from identification of a problem, question, or hypothesis, reviewing the existing literature to rationalize the problem, selection of methods to investigate the question, collecting data, interpreting data using quantitative analyses and reporting findings. Each step will be accompanied by demo data sets and case studies, to provide doctoral students a flavor of designing and conducting research., View/Print Outline

Not added
Winter
Trauma, Risk and Resilience is an in-depth examination of the interconnections between trauma, its risks and resilience through the life span, with specific reference to three laws-  the  Mental Health Act, 2017, the Domestic Violence Act, 2005 and the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 in the Indian context. The course examines various facets of traumatic experiences, which constitute and reflect as 'risks' and vulnerabilities as well as coping and resilience to adverse events. The combination of risks and protective factors shape individual and collective experiences and (re) appraisal of trauma over the lifespan. The course attempts a synergistic exercise of theoretical discourse, empirical evidence, experiential learning, and case studies. This enquiry into the interconnected nature of human experiences and the laws that govern such behaviours helps learners position themselves in professional psychological practice., View/Print Outline

[ Students should have previously completed any SS or H&L courses. ]
This course is designed as an advanced undergraduate-level entry point into the complex interplay between modernity, mass atrocity, and the evolution of the international human rights regime. It begins with an exploration of the theoretical and philosophical underpinnings of violence, through which students reflect on the nature of evil, the dissolution of distinct conceptual categories related to mass atrocities (such as “victim” versus “perpetrator”), and modernity as the “necessary condition” for mass violence. It interrogates the role of empire, race, and colonialism at the foundation of international law and international relations and focuses on their continued legacies in contemporary conflicts.  Taking stock of developments in international legal norms and human rights since the middle of the 20th century, the course then seeks to generate an understanding of the international community's response to international crimes such as genocide, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity. Finally, the course critically analyses the paradoxes within the current human rights regime, the role of gender in mass violence, and the emerging concept of “ecocide as genocide” in the context of climate change. Drawing from political theory, philosophy, international relations, and sociology, this course can be expected to appeal to students interested in history, sociology, international relations, human rights, and international law., View/Print Outline

This is an upper level core course designed for students taking the SPS major, although it is open to all senior undergraduates and masters students. Ravaged by colonialism, India was born with extreme poverty and social inequalities. At independence, policymakers faced tough decisions in social and economic policy – many of which would be amended in the years to come. The second half of the 20th century was a period of great ferment, in which scholars around the world, occupying the spectrum from communist and socialist to neo-liberalism, debated how to best structure an economy and its consequences for social inequalities. This class offers a comprehensive view on the debates that animated economic policy at independence, and continue to animate policy decisions today. The course begins with theoretical debates on the nature of the market and how they shaped India’s first economic policies. It takes us through the 1991 market reforms in India, and new policy innovations thereafter. The second half of the course deals with contemporary challenges and how they relate to the market, from gender, caste, religious and class inequalities to climate change., View/Print Outline

[ Advanced knowledge of Sanskrit ]
This course aims to explore various facets of bhakti in the Puṣṭimārga Vaiṣṇava sampradāya. The sampradāya (sect) was founded by the Vedāntin and bhakti preceptor Vallabhācārya (1479-1531) to preach bhakti to Kṛṣṇa in the form of sevā performed at practitioner’s home. The founder and his successors composed several Sanskrit texts on metaphysics, sectarian doctrines, and practice (sādhanā). This course will first introduce the student to some major debates in the field of Bhakti Studies to situate the Puṣṭimārga in the larger social and intellectual history of bhakti. Then, we shall focus on the bhakti in the Puṣṭimārga. In the study of bhakti traditions (in general) and of the Puṣṭimārga (in particular), we will analyse how these traditions understand the mind, emotions, affect and mental well-being. Throughout the course, we shall delve into the following questions: How does a bhakti practitioner deal with cintā and experience happiness and bliss?  What causes cintā (worry/anxiety) in the mind of a practitioner? How does the self (ātman) relate to the mind? What is self (ātman) for the bhaktas and how does it relate to the supreme principle (brahman)? To address these questions we shall first read some secondary texts (in English) in Bhakti Studies. Then, we shall switch to reading some excerpts from Vallabha’s Sanskrit texts including the Tattvārthadīpanibandha, the Siddhāntamuktāvalī, the Navaratna, and the Vivekadhairyāśraya along with some Sanskrit and Brajbhasha commentaries. During the course, we will also visit some Puṣṭimārgīya havelīs in Ahmedabad and interview practitioners to understand their everyday practice., View/Print Outline

Most of the people have an understanding that our outward characteristics are determined by the genes encoded by the sequence in our genome. But it is not that straight forward as, if the DNA in all cells are the same then how a liver cell decides to make a liver and not the skin. There should be some factors determining the number of genes to turn on and off depending on whether it’s a liver cell or the skin cell. Few sets of genes are turned on and off in making a liver cell a liver cell and a skin cell a skin cell and this is known as epigenome. Epigenetics is a set of hereditable changes in gene expression that takes place in the cells without changing the DNA sequence.This course deals with the epigenetics and the role of various epigenetic modifications   in the development and diseases., View/Print Outline
