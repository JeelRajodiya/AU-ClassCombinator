It is also important for individuals who create any original work, be it in the scientific, literary, or cultural domain. Intellectual property rights are considered monopolistic rights, but the monopoly is a limited one as the IPRs will go in the public domain after a certain stipulated time. The ethical implications of the IPRs will be discussed and deliberated during the course through various case studies where monopolistic presence versus the social benefits are in conflict especially pharmaceutical products and/or utilitarian goods. The course will familiarize students with the popular types of intellectual properties and the legal provisions related to them and the administrative remedies which can be sought for. With the advent of technology, intellectual property protection has become a challenge due to piracy. The course deals with the technological solutions to the sustainable inventions and whether they can be protected through IPRs or not he course also looks into the contemporary issues of Intellectual Property rights in the global context. The course will also provide insight into the competitive and strategic advantages of enterprises by using Intellectual Property Rights .,",

        "Description": "Success or failure of modern day businesses cannot be measured solely by the existence or adequacy of profits. The means of profit are as important as the profit itself. These businesses, which primarily operate for economic benefits of their owners, must also take into account the interests of other stakeholders. The course deals with ethical considerations and dilemmas that affect managerial decisions and equips the learners with methods to deal with such situations. The course is delivered in two parts; foundations of ethics and managerial dilemmas in operational areas. The first part introduces foundational concepts and theories of ethics that provide different perspectives to ethical concerns and dilemmas. The second half deals with specific ethical concerns arising in functional areas of management and ways to resolve these conflicts in managerial decision-making.\u00a0,",

Theories and models in urban planning and design would be covered followed by a discussion on alternative urban development approaches and formulation of urban and transport infrastructure policy, and a liberal planning framework.  The objective of Module-2: Urban transport is to introduce urban transport infrastructure planning, design, and management.  Public transport, which is instrumental in a city\u2019s socioeconomic development, will be a key focus.  Various debates and topical issues surrounding urban planning and transport will be covered by critical review assignments.\u00a0\u00a0,",

It is not what you think and says but what they (the audience) perceive and believe. Therefore, branding is a function of strategy and psychology that embeds various facets of design in it.This course is designed to cover the fundamentals of branding and packaging to sensitize you to the decision-making process required to create a cohesive brand language. In a world dominated by brands, it is important to understand the key differentiating factor and then build an experience around it. Strategic Packaging design directly contributes to building a brand image by functional or aesthetic elements or by reinforcement of brand image by giving out an experience. This course will offer the tools and techniques required to formulate the right strategy for success.The pedagogy consists of interactive sessions with a healthy mix of fundamental theory, case studies, on the spot, and group assignments for hands-on learning.Your key takeaway from this course will be the ability to make smart decisions for building a successful brand image and a long-term plan for a lasting brand impression.,",

There are many examples of good designs which have been inspired by nature. Biomimicry is studying elements from nature: form, colour, function, movement, life cycle, growth, etc. and using it as an inspiration for designing products, spaces, visuals for communication, systems, etc.Today in our modern world and our way of life, we are moving away from our natural connection with nature. It is all the more critical that we study its various inspects to learn and use it as an inspiration for good design. The whole area of Biomimicry, Bionics, etc, has developed a lot and there is a lot more awareness about this field in current times. Toys are also recognized today as playing an important role in learning, development, building cultural connect and socio-emotional bonds and as part of the entertainment sector. Toys are a part of unstructured play and a means to create playful experiences.  In this course, we will study nature with a new perspective and explore possibilities of using it to ideate and design toys or playful elements.,",

In this introductory course, we will explore a set of influential contemporary moral theories, and learn how these can be applied to some of the most pressing moral issues of our time. We will address some aspects of the following questions. Is there a criterion for distinguishing between right and wrong? Are morals culturally relative? What is the best human life? What might be the moral bases for accepting or rejecting practices like euthanasia, abortion, affirmative action, and civil disobedience? To what extent are we obligated to assist people in need? How ought we to treat animals? What might an ethical relationship between nations look like? Finally, we will discuss a subset of key ethical issues relating to the fields of engineering, business, and bioethics.,",

During  the past few years the concept of Global Commons has extended  from  Climate and Biodiversity to  include global peace, zoonotic global pandemics like  COVID 19 , Arts and Heritage and  the global financial order. A classic case of the importance of global peace as a Global Commons is that of the volatile situation created by North Korea and the Russian invasion of Ukraine  which has had ramifications across the world by way of biodiversity loss , climate change ,global recession, oil price hikes. The  importance of multilateral and bilateral negotiations to resolve these issues  has been crucial. Meanwhile international financing agencies such as the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, the European Investment Bank and the Global Environmental Facility have developed  portfolios on climate change and biodiversity by way of direct investments and transfer of new patented technologies in low carbon technologies. The other significant development has been the advent  of digital ledgers like Block chains and AI and the metaverse which have found applications in the management of these global commons.\u00a0,",

It aims to build upon the important accounting concepts and principles including revenue recognition, inventory, depreciation, and understanding the accounting equation. The course focuses initially on how to record economic events in the accounting records (i.e., bookkeeping and accrual accounting) and how to prepare and interpret the primary financial statements that summarize a firm's economic transactions (i.e., the balance sheet, the income statement, and the statement of cash flows). The course adopts a decision-maker perspective of accounting by emphasizing the relation between accounting data and the underlying economic events that generated them thereby enabling the students to read, understand and analyse financial statements through ratio analysis. The course also explores the areas of financial shenanigans wherein the students will be able to learn how companies use financial statements to disguise economic reality.,",

Very occasionally when \u2018culture\u2019 does figure, it has a designated space, isolated from the everyday permeation of culture in just about everything we see or do. Through a series of illustrations from media, art, rituals on one hand and ordinary situations when the \u2018cultural\u2019 asserts itself both overtly and covertly, on the other hand, the course hopes to make students aware of every situation that has a cultural dimension even when we least expect it to be.,",

        "Description": "OverviewThe course covers three themes drawing high attention from the governments as well as other stakeholders including civil society and businesses. Conventionally the three themes; energy, environment and sustainability; are perceived through the lens of trade-offs. This perspective is changing in recent times. Policymakers, professionals and civil society actors are cooperating to align strategies and actions across themes to overcome societal and individual risks and to gain co-benefits and comparative advantage. In many environmentally proactive entities, \u201csustainability\u201d is a core issue that is increasingly integrated with organizational processes, systems and strategies. Delineation of policies to align energy, environment and sustainability is a highly explored subject drawing interest from researchers and practitioners. The course is divided into four modules which combine distinct yet inter-related concepts around the three central themes. The sessions cover the landscape ranging from global, national to local, spanning technologies, management and concepts from social sciences and ecology.\u00a0Objectives\u2022Introduce the energy, environment and sustainability themes and their nexus;\u00a0\u2022Explore the contemporary perspectives and approaches to sustainability;\u2022Assess practical frameworks for aligning the policies and actions to maximize welfare of present and future generations;\u2022Delineate the mix of policy and technology innovations to harmonize the environment, energy and sustainability nexus into the future.,",

        "Description": "Energy companies are among the fastest-growing companies, both in terms of revenue and profits. In India, nine of the top fifteen companies are in the business of energy exploration, production, and/or distribution. Apart from the conventional energy businesses, new avenues have also opened up in fields of alternative energy supply, smart grids, and energy services.                              Energy businesses are facing unprecedented challenges. While the demand for energy is on the rise, conventional fossil fuel stocks are uncertain and depleting, there is a global imperative to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases. Since energy businesses often transcend national borders, they are exposed to global geopolitical, financial, and environmental market risks.There is a need for MBA students to understand forms of energy, sources of energy, energy generation technologies, storage, and the history of conventional and renewable energies.\u00a0The course will challenge the prevailing definitions and the concepts of renewable energy and sustainability through YouTube videos, slides, assignments, and the final exam. Course is P/NP.\u00a0,",

The intent is to give a foundation in design to students enrolled in any programme at the University by exposing them to the basic design fundamentals - principles, methods, processes and approaches. The course will expose the students to the user-centric approach that design adopts to address local and global challenges. They will learn to recognise that design is exploratory in nature and helps navigate ambiguity. It promotes new ways of looking at problems and coming up with solutions which are human-centered and inclusive.With practical exercises, the course will give an overview of the critical design thinking used for problem identification and opportunity mapping in any given context. Students will gain an understanding of design as a creative problem-solving tool to come up with holistic solutions for products, services, systems and experiences. The course is expected to rouse a student\u2019s interest in design. It will equip them with the necessary grounding to pursue design as a higher education or career pathway. Importantly, it will add a richer and diverse perspective to their understanding of their own field of Major education be it management, technology, sciences, humanities or social sciences.This course is open for students who are admitted to any programme at the University,",

Digital is no longer a grey area. It becomes inevitable that the brand language be effectively transformed from one media to another without changing the brand image. Throughout this course, the focus would be to expose students to ideas, applications, experiences and opportunities that are relevant to today\u2019s times. This course is primarily about creating visual artefacts that communicate effectively, but that does not mean you need to be an artist to succeed. Assessment will focus upon your efforts and your willingness to engage with your classmates to provide feedback and learn from one another. The more time you spend with the exercises in this course, the more skills you will develop as a visual communicator. Take the time to explore each exercise, take risks, and reiterate often. Don\u2019t allow your first attempt at any solution to be your only attempt. Fail early and fail often. Learning what doesn\u2019t work is an essential process in understanding what does work. This course is open for students who are admitted to any programme at the University.    ,",

Students engage with a set of foundational humanities texts that address questions emerging at the interface of philosophy, history, and literary studies. Students read primary sources in translation from a number of literary traditions such as Telugu, Persian, Tamil, Sanskrit, and Kashmiri sources. Alongside these primary sources, students are introduced to major theoretical perspectives from which to read and interpret these sources.  The course introduces students to early arguments about what distinguishes the human and natural sciences; problematizes and studies the human experience as represented in literature, philosophy and history; and concludes by thinking about the future of the humanities both in India and globally. ,",

        "Description": "This course introduces students to the fundamental concepts of state and society as they are understood in the social sciences and explores their mutual relationships. How have classical theories conceptualised the state and society? How is the historical evolution of the state and society in the West different from the way they have evolved in the Global South, especially in India? The big transformations in information technology and capitalism in the 21st century have fundamentally impacted the state and social interactions. Through a focus on theory and empirical studies, the course explores five key themes or dimensions of the state-society interaction: 1. What is the state?; 2. What is society?; 3. Civil Society, social movements and citizenship; 4. Sociality and politics in the age of internet; 5. State, market society and neoliberalism.   The course will explore the following questions pertaining to its five themes: 1.What are the important theoretical perspectives about the state (Weberian and Marxist)? How is the state experienced in the everyday lives of people in India?  2.What does social theory tell us about the fundamental elements of society and social life (Emile Durkheim)? What are the dominant features of pre and post-independent Indian society? 3.What is civil society and does it always strengthen democracy? How do social movements challenge the existing status quo of the state and society and when do they fail to do so?  4.How has digital media technology transformed classical notions of the public sphere and what are its implications for social relations and harmony?   5.What is market society and how has market thinking permeated social lives? What is the history and rise of neoliberalism and why is it best understood as a political project? ,",

This PHL course will also count towards a Minor in Philosophy.In this course, we will concern ourselves with a set of philosophical writings dealing with hermeneutics, or the theory of interpretation. We interpret actions and events in our everyday lives, as also literary creations like poems and plays, sacred books, archives, and the law. What does it mean to interpret a text? First of all, what is a text? Is it merely something written, or can anything that has meaning for us be considered a text? Is there a difference between interpretation, explanation, and our everyday understanding of the world? Is there a particular method, like the scientific method, that we can apply to interpret a text? Are some readings of a text better than others? Can an interpretation ever be universal? How should we conceive of language in the process of interpretation? We will engage with such questions in conversation with some key readings from the modern Western hermeneutical tradition.                                                                ,",

It is a survey course that extensively reviews the various aspects of the British colonial rule over the Indian subcontinent. The period covered is roughly between 1850s to 1940s. In the first couple of weeks, we will acquaint ourselves with the state and society in the Indian subcontinent before the advent of the colonial rule. However, the bulk of the course will examine in detail the impact of British imperial rule on India. We will explore the major political, social and cultural events with a focus on three themes: Caste, Print media and Nation. We will examine the emergence of caste as a form of politics; as an ideological battle-ground; and as a discourse. We will also engage with different vernacular publics that emerged through the rise of print in the nineteenth century India to explore the circulation and dissemination of the idea of the Indian nation. Gender and religion will be some of the other overlapping themes we will explore. ",

Although the course is located within SPS, it will also be of interest to students in PHL, and other majors, as it broadly deals with the making and applicability of concepts.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The course invites students from different disciplines to engage with the project of turning the \u2018social\u2019 into an object of inquiry. Building on the sense that though freely used in everyday life the word \u2018social\u2019 is little understood, the course will enable students to ask what makes a phenomena, a process, an event or a form of knowledge \u2018social\u2019. They will be able to ask and address questions such as, Do only human beings have society? How does one theorise something that is seemingly so near to us? And, why to theorise it in the first place? What is theory? Etc.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The course will open up these possibilities by introducing students to the various ways in which the \u2018social\u2019 has been broached and understood, particularly in the domain of inquiry we refer to as social theory. Students will learn to evaluate and apply theoretical perspectives to the world around them, and to appreciate both the possibilities and limitations of theorising as a way of understanding. The course has been designed in a way that students get a sense of the \u2018social\u2019 as a problem and not just as an abstract concept. They will get to see how various forms of social explanation developed in response to specific problems, and hence, how to assess them accordingly. The tensions and possibilities residing in each approach to the \u2018social\u2019 will be laid bare, enabling students to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each. They will be able to critically assess which of these approaches suits their own research interests best, and to use it productively and with awareness.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It is a reading intensive course and students will be expected to consistently work on challenging texts by major social theorists, anthropologists and historians. A typical class meeting will consist of lecturing, reading together as a class and discussion.   ,",

His writings shaped the literary landscape of the Hindi-Urdu-speaking world and encapsulated the evolving hopes, struggles, and social consciousness of his time. By engaging with his works, students will explore how Premchand's storytelling contributed to the broader cultural and intellectual fabric of Hindi-speaking society.The course will approach Premchand's literature through two critical frameworks. The first will contextualize his work within the historical backdrop of the Indian national movement, with a particular emphasis on Gandhi's Hindustani ideals and the socio-political currents of the time. The second framework will bring Premchand's reflections on pressing issues such as caste, class, gender, communalism, and nationalism into dialogue with contemporary debates, highlighting the enduring relevance of his literary contributions.Premchand's ability to straddle the worlds of both Hindi and Urdu literature makes him a vital figure for understanding the composite culture of North India. By examining his work, students will gain new perspectives on the historical roots of today's social issues and the role of literature in shaping collective imagination.,",

These mediums will be an entry point to think about spaces and sites beyond the studio per se and will foreground this complex interplay between practice and space, in conjunction with social realities. Students will do hands-on projects that will form an introduction to specific studio art practices, intermediality, and their histories.\u00a0",

Scenic design would teach scene design specific to theatre. The course has been structured to have a holistic approach to the idea of creation and design. Focus would remain heavy on learning the \u2018process\u2019 that one must go through to create; building a base, a backstory, researching, rejecting and revisiting during the process of ideation.Following is the breakdown of how the course is structured: - Movement and composition in acting - Acting and Space design - Creating images from text - Light design - Set design - Sound and music - 3D mapping as new technology - Design principles in scenography - Types of theatres and theatre architecture \u2028,",

The course attempts to dwell on both parts, as the latter is important in initiating, and refining the other part.

Each step will be accompanied by demo data sets and case studies, to provide doctoral students a flavor of designing and conducting research.\u00a0,",

Methodologically, students will learn how maps work, where mapped data come from, and how maps contribute to the analysis of social phenomena across fields such as urban planning, history, public health, and business. Importantly, students will develop quantitative literacy by learning how to acquire spatial data, make maps, critically evaluate what is mapped and what is not, as well as derive spatial relationships between multiple types of information.

The course will explore how this theory applies to cognitive functions such as attention, perception, and decision-making. Students will learn about the probabilistic models underlying neural processes and how these models inform our understanding of attention mechanisms. Students will develop a comprehensive understanding of how Bayesian principles are applied to brain function and cognition through a blend of theoretical lectures, computational exercises, and research discussions.",

This course is particularly useful for those who seek to understand South Asia with a view to pursuing research and careers in public policy, business, banking and finance, international relations and diplomacy, trade, connectivity, transnational policy and business, and energy security, among several other pursuits. SPS 267 is designed as a companion course to SPS 266: India and South Asian Matrix, but it can also be taken independently. The course is taught from a real-time perspective to discuss the dynamics and realistic prospects of emerging/future geo-economics, trade, and connectivity in South Asia: specifically, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, the Maldives, and Afghanistan, and the influence/relevance of two key neighbours: China and Myanmar. The course offers case studies of states such as Tripura that have taken the lead in regional relations, and the experience of businesses from major South Asian countries that have invested in the region.\u00a0,",

        "Description": "Art, Material and Media is a course open for students interested in the creative process of art-making who would like to develop an understanding about the layered process of art-making and artistic inquiry.This practice-based course explores the creative process and the intimate relationship between materials and mediums of art through an exploration of four significant and interwoven concepts -- object, subject, space and temporality.  The course will unpack these four conceptual categories through various practical and theoretical entry-points and demonstrate how they are integrated in order to produce meaningful and coherent works of art.Students will delve into a guided dissection of the process of art-making with a sharp focus on how materials and mediums are chosen, perceived and assembled to create a work of art. This understanding will be developed through an exposure to various forms of art-making and their processes. This will be explored hands-on through practice-based projects developed by students across this course.,",

        "Description": "It may be argued that democracy has emerged as the most desirable, if not the most successful, form of government in the contemporary world. Regardless of whether we like a particular democracy or not, arguments about what is the most legitimate and just form of rule point towards democracy. Why is democracy seen as the most just form of rule? How did such a situation come about historically? Is there evidence to show that, all things considered, democracies are indeed the most just form of government known to us?  Are there specific civic virtues that help democracies flourish? Is there a particular way in which agreement, dissent, cooperation, and conversation between different groups and individuals in a democratic society is to be carried out? Would democracy be a necessary component of a just system of government? And would social justice be a necessary component of democratic government?  These are some of the questions that this course will tackle. The entire course is built on two central ideas about democracy: a) how best to safeguard against arbitrary exercise of state power, and b) how best cultivate the virtue of democratic conversation. The course is divided into four taught modules and a fifth project module. Each of the four modules are built around a normative statement, which is supposed to provoke and organise the discussions within that module. The four normative statements are: Module 1: \"Democracy is the most just form of government\" Module 2: \"Rights take precedence over popular will\" Module 3:  \"Inequality is antithetical to democracy\u201d ,",

        "Description": "              Since time immemorial, human activities have significantly impacted the nature of our planet. Issues such as depleting resources, climate extremes, land degradation, food insecurity, unsustainable consumption and unequal access to resources, pollution, ecosystem degradation and extinction of species have posed challenges of sustainability that span spatial and temporal scales. However, in the recent past, efforts related to conservation and sustainability have also increased manifold, paving the way for a slightly hopeful future. On the crossroads of these vectors, multiple questions such as: what are the sustainability challenges facing humanity? How do we measure environmental footprints? How do we assess uncertainties and risks? Who bears the burden of costs and risks? Can we make our consumption behavior sustainable? How do we create, replicate and upscale innovative ideas? How do we evolve a just governance system to share costs and benefits equitably?, etc. need to be addressed and answered. The millennials must be equipped to comprehend and answer these questions in a meaningful and an engaging manner. This course, through an integration of diverse domains - materials, data science, biology and life, behaviour, communication, and constitution and civilization, will expose students to 1. appreciate and develop an integrated understanding of these issues and their interactions, 2.                    ,",

Both highlight the urgency for us to act - as citizens and as scientists. However, how much do we think of water? How much do we know of this resource apart from what we have read in our school textbooks? Is the water crisis real? Are we taking the right decisions today to secure a better future for the coming generations? How can I, as an individual and as a community participate in the process? Also, as the driver for all forms of life on earth, water is an excellent solvent, however, this excellent solvent\u2019s characteristic, when combined with its flow, makes it a potent carrier of pollutants and pathogenic microorganisms that are often harmful to health. So, what makes water safe to consume and use for many other purposes? Is the water in surface and groundwater bodies in the Ahmedabad area safe for all forms of life? Is it potable? This course will turn students into aware citizens of the country by enabling them to ask relevant questions around the subject of water.                                        ,",

The second phase, includes development of concept deigns, evaluation of alternative designs, and concept design finalization. Various design techniques, e.g. TRIZ, Poka Yoke, FMEA, etc. and materials selection using CES are used to prepare engineering drawings resulting in a complete engineering design including Bill of Materials (BoM). To realize the design, techniques of DFM, DFA, are applied and manufacturing drawings are prepared. After making or buying the components, the assembly is carried out to realize the proof-of-concept. After testing, the products are displayed in an expo. Finally, manuals are prepared, and recyclability aspects are addressed.,",
