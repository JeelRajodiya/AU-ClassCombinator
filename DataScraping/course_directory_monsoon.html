While developing effective business strategy is important to organizational success, the capacity to implement any given business strategy is completely dependent on a corporation’s people. 																																					 														         The Strategic Human Resource Management module provides students with a critical understanding of the theories, principles, historical trends, current issues and practices relevant to human resource management strategy in organisations. This will support the development of subject specific and key  transferable skills necessary for employment in roles which require the effective management of both  human and knowledge capital within the organisation, therefore extending beyond purely human  resource management roles.

While quantitative methodologies and the need for big data drive research in Management studies, this course demonstrates how far business history is a truly global field, even while studying it from a national framework. To draw in-depth, fine-grained comparisons across different regions of the country, examining strategies of firms, states, and business associations, students stand to gain new perspectives into their own businesses while participating in current debates in adjacent fields such as political economy and global businesses.  This course on the history of Indian Business is multidisciplinary in its nature, where history and business are conjointly examined as important tools for understanding human nature and its past endeavors, throwing light on the present and future in many ways for the young managers/entrepreneurs.  By following a project based learning pedagogy, this course attempts at enabling students to understand history as contemporary, everyday lived experience.  </span><br><br>

The course also covers the role and impact of technology on modern-day businesses, viz. how technology impacts organizations and how tech-based businesses strategize.

Businesses are vying to find newer and better ways to manage their resources in the present dynamic environment. Organisation Development is a handy tool that enables organisations to bring in desirable planned changes. In the wake of the current pandemic, embracing change and shifting to newer paradigms has become a new normal for all organisations. A hybrid organisation seems almost inevitable for some time to come. This makes understanding of OD all the more pivotal and necessary. As organisations struggle with or embarks willingly on the path of change, the knowledge of OD and its process driven approach to managing change will go a long way in shaping the immediate and future concerns and aims of modern day organisations. 																																					 														         This course aims to bring out comprehensively the basic principles of OD theory and practice, its history, the process of organisational diagnosis and how one can use various OD interventions at different unit levels (individual, group, inter-group and organisation) to facilitate the process of planned change in an organisation. This course also allows students to look at people, product and process challenges of organisations from multiple perspectives. The course aims to develop new learning and skills in the areas of observation, problem solving and decision making among the students. The course aims to foster interdisciplinary thinking and experiential learning among the students through reflections, discussions and hands-on-learning opportunities. </span><br><br>

Premier organizations strive to strategize their human resource policies and man-power requirements in a way that not only ensures smooth compliance of employment laws but generates greater benefits for an internal stakeholder. 

This course discusses in detail the Labour Codes applicable in India. It starts by examining the constitutional aspects of labour laws.

A leader is no longer a person with authority who can guide a group of people to a defined goal. The course will highlight the understanding of leadership in the context of influence as suggested by John Maxwell. A modern leader is authentic, leads by example, encourages, empowers, and nurtures people around her /him. S/he is empathetic towards needs of others, is humble and emotionally intelligent. This course aims to enable participants understand and develop leadership insights and competencies at self, group and organisational levels. At the theoretical level, the course aims to provide conceptual frameworks to understand various aspects of leadership at the said three levels. It would highlight the seminal works of John Maxwell, Kouzes and Posner, Richard Daft, Bill George, James Scouller, Ken Blanchard, Jim Collins and Robert Greenleaf among others.   At the application level, the course aims to provide necessary knowledge and skills required to develop a Leadership repertoire in personal and professional contexts through reflections, experiential learning and classroom discussions.  The course would help participants to gain insights into Authentic Leadership and how one can become an effective leader by knowing one’s self and people around us.
																																					
														        
The course will help students to bring in changes at a personal level through reflections and introspection and will help them understand their own values, skills, goals, leadership purpose, leadership readiness etc.

										<td><br><span> 																 																																 																 																 																In human history, the city has existed both as an idea and a place. Also, cities often develop around very different purposes. For instance, some cities become the space for national and international political activities, and some become the hub for business and trade. Other cities are primarily seen as sites for tourism and leisure. However, apart from these images, a city is also subject to continuous change—such as political, cultural, social and religious—which affect the lifestyle of city-dwellers and the image of a city from time to time. Viewed, thus, in the above perspective, City as Text course broadens the idea of a text as a landscape which includes cultural artifacts, institutions, and street cultures, socio-political and economic discourses. This course is interdisciplinary (provides economic perspective, cultural landscape analysis, political and social analysis, and historical background) and would mainly focus on urban formal and informal spaces such as commercial, residential and public. Learning processes in this course are characterized in three main ways:  •	Firstly, intellectual development – understanding the specific socio-economic, cultural, and political factors that have shaped the city and the integration of theoretical and practical concepts. The urban environment enables a variety of different modes of learning, including guided student discovery and interpretation. •	Secondly, technical development - students have the opportunity to hone observation and analytical skills, and competence in information processing and research, as they are brought into direct first-hand contact with the object of their investigation. And as an arena of encounter and interaction, the urban environment facilitates processes of personal development. •	Finally, with the help of digital humanities pedagogy, students will be able to study the intersection between technology and the human experience using the digital tool. This pedagogy will help students to learn the nuances of computing methods to do humanities research. 																					 														 																					 														 																					 														 																					 																																			 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>This course offers an introduction to the study of investments in a portfolio context. In doing so, it exposes students to the breadth of investment alternatives and portfolio construction to meet certain investment objectives. Different individuals or institutions will have differing investment objectives. The course will start with a discussion of the ways in which objectives vary, and the resulting portfolio implications. After a brief review of the various markets and their structures we will turn to one of the cornerstones of modern finance - "Modern Portfolio Theory". This is an emphasis on the importance of constructing optimal portfolios, in which diversification is used to achieve a target objective. It holds that capital should be allocated among the major asset groups in order to arrive at a balance of risk and return that matches the circumstances and objectives of the investor. Only after this allocation does individual security selection come into play.We will then go to a review of asset pricing theory, with a brief stop at equity valuation, and bond mathematics. In doing so, students would be exposed to different methods of valuation namely DCF, Relative Valuation and Economic Value Added in the context of deriving the intrinsic value of a share. This is followed by an overview of equity and bond portfolio management strategies and a review of prevailing portfolio performance measures. The course concludes with the question of performance evaluation - how do we measure success as compared to the original objectives?While a predominant proportion of the course contents fall within the contours of "Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)", the course also acclimatizes students on the trajectory of discourse on market efficiency – EMH to Behavioral Finance to Adaptive Market Hypothesis (AMH).  </span><br><br>

														        Organisations are a combination of interactions, relationship and processes that are played out in various scenarios to make the organisation function efficiently. These interactions are not simple in nature and may lead to varied outcomes. Consequently, making an organization a system that is constantly evolving in terms of people, behaviour and its reaction to the systems. In the contemporary world, variables of data, technology, automation, shared economy, behaviour, people and interactions are the reason for any organisation to sustain and leap. Owing to ambidexterity in organisations and people, we see a drastic shift that organisations are going to work. The pandemic has acted as a catalyst for numerous changes in organisations. Thus, making it more critical and intricate to understand the interaction among people, behaviour and the organisations in which we work. The course will be an introduction to concepts that are going to be a part of students/ Managers organisational life. The students shall be able to test their understanding of the concepts that we introduce by examining Organisational life cycle and its various components. This will involve understanding, reflecting and looking at processes that are part of the organisational life of individuals, members of a team or organisations. We shall focus on the following:•    What is organisation for an individual?•    Based on my life and experiences, how do I look at the idea of organisation.•    As a manger/ Employee/ or entrepreneurs what will be my role in an organisation.The course is designed to introduce students to the ideas of Managing people in organisations. While going through the course, they will be able to understand, reflect, debate around the life of and life in organisations during the changing times. Each topic will be acting as the building blocks of organisations and life within them.

Several classical and neo-classical theories from the disciplines of psychology and social psychology would be discussed. The understanding of these concepts and theories would facilitate the understanding of groups and organisations in future courses. It would equip the students to develop people skills and enable them to deal with issues such as improving productivity, job satisfaction, motivation, learning etc. in organisations. The course would promote self-awareness and interpersonal awareness and students’ ability to work in groups and in organizational settings. The course would focus on concepts which facilitate the understanding of the ‘Self’ and ‘Identity’ followed by its implication on human behaviour.</span><br><br>

Design is a set of activities and processes to bring about this improvement and beneficial change on their own. Design Thinking is a set of activities and processes to let design happen on its own. It is aimed at making designerly behaviour a very core mindset and bodyset.Design Thinking in the modern context is recognised as a core business activity which is capable of enhancing all activities around it, making them better and more human and consequently profitable as well. Over the years, it has developed as a very robust and ever-evolving combination of design, science, human behaviour and business principles. At the centre of this is the target user for whom systems are built to understand them, empathise with them define their problems and help them solve these problems through strategically targeted design interventions. Ultimately, all business is about the people who invest in it through one or the other level of consumer behaviour.

														        Human resource management is the process of gaining a competitive advantage through people. Organizational performance is driven by people, and it depends on certain measures. Human Resource (HR) experts need to be skilled at planning and interpreting organizations' people metrics. This requires a solid understanding of HR analytics, i.e., the systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of data considered to improve decisions about talent and moreover the organization at large. The application of analytics is changing the way HR managers quantify the value that people (i.e., talent) - a company’s biggest asset - have on the organization's ability to succeed in the market or in its mission. For enabling managers to make smart decisions about talent, HR needs to effectually leverage data. When equipped with metrics that are suitably designed and easy to interpret, HR can render managers with analytics to make decisions which will not only improve operations nonetheless also create systemic advantages. Data and sophisticated analysis are brought in the dynamics to effectively handle people-related issues viz., recruiting, hiring and promotion, performance evaluation, leadership, collaboration, job design, and compensation. The curriculum is of an introductory nature to the theory of people analytics. It is not intended to prepare learners to perform complex talent management data analysis. At the conclusion of this course, you will be able to understand that how and when hard data is operated to make soft-skill decisions about hiring and talent development; therefore, you may level yourself as a strategic partner in the company’s talent management decisions. The course will help students in three distinct ways. One, it will provide students with the latest grounding in current evidence on managing people, providing a knowledge base which shall ensure that their future management is led by the best practices. Second, develop the understanding and skills that are necessary to be thoughtful, critical consumers of data on people management, allowing them to make an in-depth analysis as they make people decisions. Third, provide direction and practice in conducting people analytics, preparing students to gather their own data, and making students more skilled analysts. These goals will be pursued through a mixture of case discussion, lecture, and hands-on exploration of a variety of data sets. The course is intended to introduce you to the fact that Organizations flourish when the people who work in them flourish. Analytics can help make both happen.

										<td><br><span>Heritage is a broad concept that draws from various disciplinary discourses including anthropology, architecture, art, culture, development, ecology, environment, forestry, geography, history, natural resources, traditional arts and crafts, urban design and planning, wildlife and so on. However, a general perception of heritage usually refers only to the historic and monumental examples of heritage. Even within the monument-centric discourse, it is widely perceived that the objective of heritage conservation and management is to ‘preserve’ heritage as it is (the cult of the ruins) by using conservation and preservation as a technical process of ensuring the longevity of the ruins. However, it is widely accepted and followed today that the heritage discourse has evolved much broadly to account for change and continuity, the intangibles and more recently calls have been made to view heritage holistically. As opposed to the conservation / preservation paradigm, an interdisciplinary management paradigm is evolving through discourses as well as frameworks of practice at different levels. 
																																					
														        This course provides an overview of both the conventional notions and the evolving concepts. Hence, it gives a critical foundation to heritage understanding and makes students aware of a range of global frameworks that have been influencing current heritage practices. 
This will be a foundational course to begin both for Masters as well as Doctoral students in heritage management. </span><br><br>

														        The area of behaviour is no more restricted solely to experimentation and to decode behaviour for work output. In these contemporary times, managers are challenging the accepted results of a traditional understanding of behaviours. The idea of how behaviour contributes at business, society, and technology levels is changing. The idea of behaviour lab is to deliver behaviour to look at businesses, areas, and domains affected by it. Addictive behaviour, Networks, Irrational decisions, Mapping behaviour online are the newer areas where behaviour’s application has become more relevant. This also means developing skills to understand, analyse and apply behaviour in other areas that are not just restricted to Businesses. Thus, learning behaviour with a more interdisciplinary focus and having skills to understand and analyse them. Consequently, such skills facilitate a person to survive what waits for them in the professional world. Workplace challenges, often fuelled by a keen intuition, can now form the basis of experiments that allow us to understand the processes, decisions, communities and how they work in tandem to achieve or/ and survive changes. Behaviour Lab equips students with tools, methods and interventions aligned with these changes and also help them later in their journey in the business world. Moreover, the course makes them aware of how the behaviour domain is contributing in areas that were untouched earlier.

Answers to these questions are not simple, and there scarcely exists a unique solution for any one of them. Nevertheless, principles of economics, both micro and macro, often provide an interesting and effective framework on which the logic of international economic issues can be constructed.  																 																																					 														        																					 														         EPP530 International Economics provides an insight into some of these principles and equips graduate students with the understanding of the functioning of the economies in a globalized world.

										<td><br><span>This introductory course introduces students to the methods of lab and field experiments and the behavioural principles and theories of human decision making. Against the backdrop of Neoclassical economics (specifically Expected Utility Theory), this course will discuss deviations from the standard concepts of individual preferences, beliefs, and decision-making processes. In doing so, we will see that people are loss-averse, present-biased, more social, and often use heuristics in their decision-making. Experimental evidence from education, labour, health, public economics/finance and development economics will elucidate these ideas.  More broadly, this course will provide students with an overview of how researchers and policymakers have leveraged their understanding of behavioural and experimental economics to study and find solutions to fix undesirable or less desirable individual decisions (from a social planner’s perspective). Considering that this is an introductory course, the theory and experiments will be discussed with a greater focus on intuition and a lesser emphasis on the technicalities. The mathematical technicalities, along with the fine details behind the design of an experiment, could be worked upon in a more advanced level course on experimental and/or behavioural economics. 																 																 																																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>An annual report is a powerful and revealing document about a company’s financial standing. To a trained professional it gives a substantial insight into where a company may be headed in the future. However, to an untrained eye the annual report may seem like walls of accounting technicalities provided to fill space between the glossy photos and the upbeat messages from the CEO. In many aspects, reading an annual report could be a daunting task as it is a mixture of factual financial results and public relation information. There is a wide communication gap between the world of compliance and disclosure. It is difficult to interpret and understand the information provided in slick expensively produced annual reports. There can be no better piece of information about a company than annual reports but it is essential to cut through the marketing clutter in annual reports and extract vital information (financial content) that shows true picture of the company.
																																					
														        This enable course will take the students through an intellectual tour of an annual report of the companies. It is designed and meant to develop skills to translate and read between the lines of the published financial statements and Notes to Accounts. It enhances the skill to sense the bigger picture behind the reporting of a company. The part of the course covers tools of financial analysis, including methods of evaluating accounting quality and corporate performance. The course shall address multiple issues pertaining to components of the Annual report like Management Discussion and Analysis (MDA), Directors Report (DR), Financial Highlights and Corporate Governance of the Companies. Through real world examples of listed/unlisted companies and projects, the course focuses on reading the annual reports with the thorough understanding of all the components essential for understanding the working of the company, its peers, economic environment, marketing aspects, growth trajectory, vision and analysis of the management, Auditors’ Remarks and the human resource and ethics as a part of corporate Governance. Students will learn to make better use of annual reports focusing on key issues, raising pertinent questions, and enhancing their understanding of the overall profile of the companies they are assessing.

																In an attempt to acquire a competitive advantage and maximise profit, companies seek ways to enhance customer loyalty.
																																					
														        The most powerful tool to this end is the model of designing experiences. ‘Experience’, differentiated from ‘service’, is a personal, particularly strong connection, based on emotions and imprinted in memory, that the company develops with its customers. 
It is important to note that the model has proved successful even at periods of instability/crisis.
The course presents the principles, methodologies and practical tools of the experience model, and applies it to a wide range of heritage organisations and sectors (such as cultural tourism, fashion/design/ traditional crafts, cultural events, educational programs and digital technology applications) with respect to heritage significance and values.
In this context, the key challenges for heritage organisations are to incorporate the experience model in their:
• strategy: customer experiences at the core of the business model, and not as an incidental byproduct
• management: setting in place and linking management levels, people, and processes for the designing and offering of experiences
• branding and marketing: creating a strong brand centred on customer experience; and communicating the offering of experiences to the customers, through various advertising channels. 
A wide range of heritage organisations, international and Asian and Indian ones, are used as case studies.
The ultimate aim of the course is to help current and potential managers design unique customised experiences, sustaining and expanding their organisations’ customer base and increasing customer loyalty.
The course is open to students of diverse backgrounds and interests. 
The course is offered to both postgraduate and undergraduate students.

										<td><br><span>'Business-model' is a buzz word now in boardrooms, especially when the business encounters problems. The managers agree or disagree if the present business model is working any more or it needs navigation. To put it simply, a business model is both a short- and long-term framework of plans and moral rules within which a business operates. If the business model is strong it creates value and business prospers. Reverse happens when the business model is week. Over a period of time, an existing business calibrates its business model in keeping with the surrounding changes to remain relevant otherwise it may perish. A carefully designed business model has an inherent strength but it may not be long lasting. Hence, calibration is necessary from time to time. A rightly calibrated business model can act as a game changer. Today’s business models were imagined a decade ago and we have to create tomorrow’s business model considering many unknown bets.  Therefore, formal education and intelligent hard work are necessary to create a winning business model. Even though there are some generic and popular business models developed by experts, the owners and managers can bypass the standard ones and create a differentiated business model most suited to their businesses. This course mainly deals with identifying and placing various business drivers in sequence and changing it whenever and wherever necessary in order to make competitive business models. </span><br><br>

																Covid-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of the healthcare and pharmaceutical sector and why a well-functioning healthcare sector is an essential prerequisite for India to emerge as a global superpower. Given the increasing importance of healthcare and pharmaceutical, it is vital to understand how the pharmaceutical industry works, the trade-offs involved, and why it has one of the highest R&D spendings and innovation rates? Why are healthcare sector costs so high, what are the linkages between physicians, pharmaceutical, and medical devices, and how can we manage these linkages? With increased funding for healthcare and the accelerated emergence of technologies ranging from mRNA to DNA-based vaccines, AI-enabled healthcare, and personalised medicine, the innovation landscape is evolving rapidly, creating newer challenges and opportunities.

It is not what you think and says but what they (the audience) perceive and believe. Therefore, branding is a function of strategy and psychology that embeds various facets of design in it.This course is designed to cover the fundamentals of branding and packaging to sensitize you to the decision-making process required to create a cohesive brand language. In a world dominated by brands, it is important to understand the key differentiating factor and then build an experience around it. Strategic Packaging design directly contributes to building a brand image by functional or aesthetic elements or by reinforcement of brand image by giving out an experience. This course will offer the tools and techniques required to formulate the right strategy for success.The pedagogy consists of interactive sessions with a healthy mix of fundamental theory, case studies, on the spot, and group assignments for hands-on learning.Your key takeaway from this course will be the ability to make smart decisions for building a successful brand image and a long-term plan for a lasting brand impression.																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

So, why do so many products and services fail to achieve this ideal? All products, whether digital or otherwise, must deliver a high-quality user experience or risk losing users to competitors.The focus of interaction design is on user-centred design based on the understanding of real users including their experiences, goals, needs, wants and tasks. The goal of interaction design is also to collect and analyse data to make informed interface design decisions which are critical to creating and delivering successful products, services and systems that fulfil the user/customer, technological and business needs. </span><br><br>

It brings the power of computational analysis to problems and possibilities in humanities and related disciplines. This course aims to inform students of transdisciplinary research being undertaken within the purview of DH to equip them with the ability to hypothesise and 'critically-make' new media projects.The students are expected to incorporate a 50:50 ratio in their study of theory and implementing solutions hands-on. Students will be guided to prototype solutions that bridge their primary field of study with the Humanities. The course will result in the culmination of a final project answering a research question. Students will engage closely in a project that results in the culmination of a DH-platform as part of their evaluation.The tools that will primarily be used are Python, Google Collab, miscellaneous OpenAccess methods for text, network, spatial analyses will be encouraged. Students need not have any prior knowledge of these tools to register for this course. The coursework would broadly involve the creation of a data essay, a piece of alternative or multimodal writing and towards the development of an OpenAccess digital platform to highlight digital scholarship in Indian galleries, libraries, archives and museums (GLAM) for he general public.</span><br><br>

An organization with a project culture is one that knows where it is going, is focused on results and has a professional team who knows what is expected of them. Professionals & organizations working or desiring to start a new venture in diverse fields require an understanding and insight of Project Management concepts and methods. Projects are vital and often businesses and various functions start with this management operation. Initial activities within a function also start with projects, for e.g. Launching a new product in the market or implementing ERP within the organisation. The products are developed at lab scale, tried at pilot scale and produced at plant scale.  To handle all these activities later in their careers, management students have to learn Project Management techniques and through planning and control techniques to execute projects.</span><br><br>

Topics covered would include those related to development and sustainability: the degree of substitutability between natural resources and produced forms of capital (namely physical and human) and limits to growth implied by it. Since economic growth of developing nations often involves rising pollution, the course would also spend some time on discussing the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC). The course concludes with “greening” the system of national accounts and attempts to include value of environmental services within the national product of countries (including the case for India). The course would be based on rigorous theory, readings of texts and articles and numerical examples.</span><br><br>

														        Marketing intangible offerings requires a different approach than marketing physical products. By focusing on the benefits, creating a strong brand, leveraging social proof, and using targeted messaging and content marketing,  one can effectively market their intangible offering to potential customers.

Intangible offerings are everywhere and all pervasive. A Consumer comes into contact with them daily.  An intangible service is a service that cannot be physically touched or seen, such as consulting, education, banking, or healthcare. These services are typically performed by professionals or companies, and are often customized to meet the specific needs of individual customers.Many product driven organizations today have a strong service oriented intangible component. It is, therefore, becoming increasingly important to focus on how to best manage and market these. 


This course demonstrates why and how the intangible market offerings require a distinctive approach to marketing strategy for development and execution and how the intangible service aspects need to be paid attention to for a product firm.

The course aims to introduce contemporary tools of economic policy making to expose the students to the current literature of formal economic modeling.
This course attempts to find answers of questions like what determines the size and target beneficiaries of public goods, welfare programs, taxation policies, effect of corrupt public officials, politician-industrialist nexus, electoral-cycles on economic policies. 
The course takes a positivist approach of explaining economic policymaking, assuming all agents are rational and behave strategically, focusing on various kinds of incentives and constraints the policy-makers face under different political systems.

Against the backdrop of Neoclassical Economics, this course will discuss deviations from the standard concepts of individual preferences, beliefs, and decision-making processes. In doing so, we will see that people are loss-averse, present-biased, more social, and often use heuristics in their decision-making. Experimental evidence from education, labour, health, public economics/finance and management will elucidate these ideas. Students will also learn to create and implement experiments using the open-source platform, oTree.
																																					
														        
More broadly, this course will provide students with an overview of how researchers and policymakers have leveraged their understanding of behavioural and experimental economics to improve economic, policy and management outcomes. Considering that this is an introductory course, the theory and experiments will be discussed with a greater focus on intuition and a lesser emphasis on the technicalities.

																The course discusses the core concepts of sustainability. Beginning from the scientific definition of sustainability, the course gives exposure to substitution possibilities in human consumption behaviour and production decisions of firms towards more sustainable choices. The course also studies country level data to see if higher per capita incomes are associated with sustainable choices and better waste management. The course dives into what is a circular economy and how it is related to waste management. From generating energy from waste, incineration to recycling and less dependence on virgin materials, the course studies rules and regulations set by the government with regards to waste management and circular economy. 

Having taken any principles level economics course would be advantageous for taking this course. Basic understanding of concepts such as consumer behaviour, production decisions of firms and how are they related to the aggregate economy would be needed for this course.  For any student at the level of MA in Economics or MBA, this course would be useful in that issues of behavioural economics and energy conservation, how the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) varies with waste generation and recovery and per capita incomes, business opportunities out of waste recovery from landfills and recycling waste would be covered. These topics are essential towards sustainable choices, sustainability and building a circular economy.

										<td><br><span>This course is an introduction to the basic concepts and standards underlying the financial accounting systems. It aims to build upon the important accounting concepts and principles including revenue recognition, inventory, depreciation, and understanding the accounting equation. The course focuses initially on how to record economic events in the accounting records (i.e., bookkeeping and accrual accounting) and how to prepare and interpret the primary financial statements that summarize a firm's economic transactions (i.e., the balance sheet, the income statement, and the statement of cash flows). The course adopts a decision-maker perspective of accounting by emphasizing the relation between accounting data and the underlying economic events that generated them thereby enabling the students to read, understand and analyse financial statements through ratio analysis. The course also explores the areas of financial shenanigans wherein the students will be able to learn how companies use financial statements to disguise economic reality.</span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>Organizations are seen as communicative structures where communication constitutes routine job activities. In this sense, organisations are not merely seen as a place where communication happens, but it exists because employees communicate and create the sense in the existing structure. Also, the idea of the workplace has moved beyond the simple "office space" to "living social networks" that combine work, home and play. Moreover, organisations use their website and social media to communicate with internal and external stakeholders. Viewed, thus, in this context, the course looks at the constitutive view of communication and intends to familiarise students with workplace communications as practised in the corporate world. The course is interdisciplinary and involves the combination of concepts (communication, sociology and computer-mediated technology) into one project. </span><br><br>

Human behavior leads to multiple negative outcomes at organizational  units of individuals , teams and groups.The  way people may behave in organisations may not be always beneficial. Dark side behaviors typically lead to negative outcomes. Those who engage in these negative behaviors generally are aware that their actions can cause harm to others, their employer, and/or to them; hence, the instigator usually has intent. It is essential for tomorrow’s managers to understand what are these behaviors how some times they may lead to functional outcomes, sometimes it may lead to nehative outcomes as well. It is essential that we understand these behaviors, as well as control, prevent, mitigate, or ameliorate their occurrences. I.  Aim of the course is to understand what might be source of such behaviors in organizations and  is it possible to mitigate such behaviors in organizational units.   																																					 														        </span><br><br>

People working in organizations get affected not just by who they are, but also but who they are working with and aspects like their teams, leaders, organizational culture, change and communication. The course shifts away from the individual level to the group, and organizational levels of behavior drawing on concepts and practices from the field of Organizational Behavior (OB). This course provides a basic understanding of your own and others’ behavior, particularly in teams. It enhances your ability to communicate and work effectively with others.  Organization requires effective management of people and a clear understanding of human behavior and social processes. Managers need to have a good understanding both of themselves and of those whom they will lead. The prior knowledge of individuals’ perceptions, attitudes, and behavior will enable you to choose appropriate leadership styles and managerial practices to increase organization effectiveness and positive human outcomes.																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>Why are some countries richer and prosperous than others? Why does inflation increase in some economies and decline in others? What is the linkage between economic indicators and financial markets? What is the different between fiscal and monetary policies? The answer to these and several other questions lies in studying macroeconomics. Macroeconomics is an exciting subject which takes students through various theories and policies which help understand the overall economic development of a country. 

The study of macroeconomics has become even more important in recent times. In the last 15 years, world economy has seen multiple crises such as 2008 global financial crisis, 2020 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine War. These crises posed new challenges leading to many different policies from governments and central banks. The world is also facing its biggest challenge in form of climate change. These new challenges have also posed questions to the pedagogy of macroeconomics seeking new solutions. 
Angus Deaton, recipient of Nobel Prize in Economics (2016) echoed his sentiments on macroeconomics which sum up the subject well: “For me, macroeconomics is like quantum mechanics. Though it is not just me. It changes shape all of the time, and I have done economics long enough to see what is true – and what is not true – change places over and over again.”  (Source: https://www.the-fence.com/issues/issue-11/nobel-endeavours)

The course covers three themes drawing high attention from the governments as well as other stakeholders including civil society and businesses. Conventionally the three themes; energy, environment and sustainability; are perceived through the lens of trade-offs. This perspective is changing in recent times. Policymakers, professionals and civil society actors are cooperating to align strategies and actions across themes to overcome societal and individual risks and to gain co-benefits and comparative advantage. In many environmentally proactive entities, “sustainability” is a core issue that is increasingly integrated with organizational processes, systems and strategies. Delineation of policies to align energy, environment and sustainability is a highly explored subject drawing interest from researchers and practitioners. The course is divided into four modules which combine distinct yet inter-related concepts around the three central themes. The sessions cover the landscape ranging from global, national to local, spanning technologies, management and concepts from social sciences and ecology. </span><br><br>

Having studied the fundamental concepts under Direct Taxes, including the taxation of an individual earning incomes from employment, owning properties, sale of capital assets and other sources, this course aims to focus on the income of an individual from Business or Profession.  It specifically includes the understanding of tax laws relating to determination of business or professional income of an individual and the deductions and disallowances applicable in determining the taxable business income of an individual. The course also aims to create an awareness of the tax benefits provided under the Income Tax Act through the deductions available to an individual based on various investments and payments made through the incomes earned, as well as through the application of the principles and rules of set off and carry forward of losses occurred under various heads of income. Another interesting aspect of this course would be to explore the situations under which the income of other persons is included in the total income of an individual commonly known as the ‘Clubbing Provisions’ of the Act.Lastly, the course also aims at understanding the income structure of an individual involving various sources of income and computing his total income liable for tax under the Act.</span><br><br>

Understanding consumer behaviour needs an interdisciplinary approach – concepts and methods from several disciplines like neuromarketing, cognitive psychology, behavioural economics, anthropology, sociology, and more. Consumers often make irrational choices. Decisions are based on emotions and unconscious motivations – not only on rational logic. Consumer choices are implicit not explicit. Consumers cannot often express their motivations in response to traditional marketing research surveys. This is because consumers either won’t say why they made some choices (as the answers might not sound logical and reasonable) or they can’t say (as choices were made at an unconscious level and they themselves do not know why they choose a brand). The course will draw on the works of several neuroscientists and behavioural economists like Daniel Kahneman, Richard Thaler, and Dan Ariely. We will use behavioural economics experiments (‘Nudge’ as Richard Thaler calls it) to see how subtle interventions influence brand choices. We will explore how ethnography – a method of immersing oneself in consumer lives (used in anthropology and sociology) – can help us get under the skin of the consumer and observe the role of products and brands in consumer life, as lived and not as claimed in surveys. 																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

It becomes inevitable that the brand language be effectively transformed from one media to another without changing the brand image. Throughout this course, the focus would be to expose students to ideas, applications, experiences and opportunities that are relevant to today’s times. This course is primarily about creating visual artefacts that communicate effectively, but that does not mean you need to be an artist to succeed. Assessment will focus upon your efforts and your willingness to engage with your classmates to provide feedback and learn from one another. The more time you spend with the exercises in this course, the more skills you will develop as a visual communicator. Take the time to explore each exercise, take risks, and reiterate often. Don’t allow your first attempt at any solution to be your only attempt. Fail early and fail often. Learning what doesn’t work is an essential process in understanding what does work.

										<td><br><span>Introductory biology is a gateway course that is essential for all biology majors and minors. A clear comprehension of the material in this course is essential for the successful completion of other courses in biology. The course covers modern biology at the molecular and cellular level and includes biological macromolecules, the biochemical and biophysical processes in respiration, energetics, metabolism, photosynthesis, cell signaling, and cell reproduction. These fundamental topics in turn lead to the genetic basis of life with classical and modern understanding of inheritance, an understanding of genes, DNA, RNA, and proteins, in sexual reproduction. The initial part of the course concludes with an introduction to biotechnology and genomics with an emphasis on laboratory techniques, genome mapping, and proteomics. The second part of the course applies our understanding of modern biology, including biotechnology, to viruses and single celled organisms such as prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea), protists, fungi, and to seed and seedless plants. No background is assumed other than basic chemistry and biology at the school level. This course can be taken by non-biology students and satisfies the general education requirement (GER). Students cannot register for both Introductory biology and BIO 107 (Concepts of biology).</span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>The city of Ahmedabad has been at the crossroads of major historical currents. A key commercial centre of western India, Ahmedabad was at the vanguard of industrialisation in modern India. Ahmedabad via the coastal port cities such as Surat was a gateway to the sea routes of the Indian Ocean via the Arabian Sea, home to influences from West Asia as well as peninsular South Asia. Although the city functioned as a political and administrative centre, it had a strong tradition of craft goods production, merchant entrepreneurship, and banking and financial services.  It maintained thriving trade contacts with  neighbouring towns and port cities as well as imperial centres at Delhi and Agra. In 1700 AD, Ahmedabad was, by some estimates, the sixth most populous city in the world[1]. Today, it continues as one of the most populous cities in India, a key node of national politics as well as business and urban development initiatives and emblematic of the opportunities and challenges before contemporary Indian society, wherein modernist development paradigms have been superimposed on traditional social structures. The course will help students understand the city as an arena for economic activities (industry, trade and commerce, and informal work), merchant communities, entrepreneurship, city life and culture, and global engagement over the centuries. It will also examine the causes and consequences of conflicts over material and symbolic resources, which have been key to the social organisation of the city. It examines various efforts at urban development charting the city’s built form for the future. Through a combination of lectures, classroom discussions, and projects the course encourages students to analyse these historical and contemporary processes in Ahmedabad in the wider historical context of Gujarat. Through these experiences, students will receive an introduction to disciplinary concepts and theories that will be built upon systematically by later courses in the student’s chosen major.‘Ahmedabad as a Gateway to the World’ is a mandatory course for all BA students majoring in History or SPS (Social and Political Sciences), and for all Integrated MBA students.

In this course, students will be given an overview of the several schools (darśana) that comprise the tradition and will be introduced to some of their important doctrines, texts and thinkers. The doctrines to be discussed during the course have their foundations in works composed over a period spanning more than three millennia, beginning with the Vedas and ending with the writings of influential contemporary thinkers such as Gandhi and Aurobindo. This course will prepare students to take the second course of the introductory set, which will present the texts and doctrines of the tradition in greater detail and thereby prepare students for further studies in this area.
 																 																																					 														        																					 														        
Readings during this course will be entirely in English, but several important terms from the primary languages (particularly Sanskrit) will be discussed throughout the course. Students will also be given readings from eminent thinkers and personalities from other disciplines (physics, neuroscience, politics, etc.) who have been influenced by specific doctrines from the Indian philosophical tradition, and students will be asked to deliberate upon these in class in light of the theories learnt.</span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>This course is the first of a set of two courses where students will learn scholastic Sanskrit through exercises drawn from various Sanskrit literary sources, such as well-known subhāṣitas, Pañcatantra, Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, etc. In this course, students will be introduced gradually to various aspects of Sanskrit morphology and syntax so as to enable them to read simple Sanskrit sentences and verses. Exercises (sentences, verses and passages) for each class will be drawn from original Sanskrit works (brief description below), and will be chosen so as to exemplify the key grammatical features which need to be explained.  																																					 														         The Pañcatantra is a famous collection of Sanskrit stories, in verse and prose, dated to around the second/third century CE and is considered a nītiśāstra (a treatise on government or political science). The Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa is one of the two famous Indian epics, a mammoth work comprising nearly 24,000 verses and which is of monumental importance and legacy.  Each class will be divided into three segments: a revision of the past lesson(s) (and review of assigned after-class exercises), the scheduled lesson, and in-class exercises taken from Sanskrit literature. There will also be surprise tests to further reinforce the learning of various grammatical features.   This course will prepare students to take the second of this set of courses, wherein students will study more advanced syntactical aspects of the language. These two courses will prepare students with the adequate training in Sanskrit grammar to begin their study of original Sanskrit works. Knowledge of the Devanāgarī script is not a prerequisite for this course.</span><br><br>

																This course introduces students to some of the most influential theories and philosophies that have informed the study and writing of history. Students will learn a variety of theoretical and historical perspectives for viewing the world and thinking about historical studies, in general. 
Students will explore the development of historical understanding and the various problems and approaches to the study of history. Student will read, discuss, and write about some of the most important works of theory and historiography. As E.H. Carr tells us, “interpretation enters into every fact of history.” Yet, historians often disagree about those interpretations. Through this course, students will recognize the ways in which those disagreements are often rooted in conflicting perspectives about the nature of reality, forms of power, human nature, and truth. 
We discuss a different theme each week including post-colonialism, gender, memory, and ‘universal’ history; and engage with major thinkers such as Hegel and Marx. 
Normally, the class reads one essay per session in order to give it close attention, but longer essays may be spread across two class meetings. A typical class meeting consists of a lecture, reading together as a class, and discussion. Students should expect to read 30-40 pages per week.

What is the nature of space and time? What is the nature of our minds, and how do they relate to our bodies? What makes us the same person over a period of time? Are we really free in our choice of actions? Can we rationally prove the existence of God?																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

Students will approach the subject through a close study of classical readings by Aristotle, Immanuel Kant, and John Stuart Mill, as well as contemporary work by such authors as Julia Driver, Amartya Sen, and Margaret Urban Walker. Among the fundamental questions to be discussed are 'what makes a life go well or poorly?', 'what makes a person good or bad?',  and 'what makes an action right or wrong?'. This is a core course for students minoring in philosophy and an elective for students majoring in PHL.

										<td><br><span>In this course, we will critically examine entities such as family, caste, class, community, language and nation, and ask how they generate powerful and sometimes conflicting loyalties among individuals. Are such associations natural and primordial, or contingent and historical? Do they have an economic rationale? How do the actions of state, law, and civil society mediate these attachments?  
																																					
														        
Over the course of 5 units— Family, Caste, Religion, Language,  and Nation— this course we will address specific questions such as: What is the history of the family as a unit? How did ideas such as the father as the head of the family, or the heterosexual couple as its anchors, come to be taken for granted? What is the social significance of marriage and how do we critically examine its current glossy, romanticized reinventions as elaborately staged spectacles? What is the significance of caste in our lives, and what is its place in Indian society? How does the Indian Constitution view caste? What is the relationship of religion to the state? Should it be private and contained within families, or spill over into streets and processions? Why have religious minorities, Dalits, and other groups at the ‘margin’ consistently challenged the idea of nationalism?  
This course builds on the understanding of the production of social identities in the introductory courses of the Social and Political Sciences programme and aims to develop a stronger theoretical foundation for analyzing key social categories. In this course, students will engage with a selection of texts focusing on categorizations along the lines of gender, family, caste, religion, language, and nation. Students will learn to critically examine these categories, their inter-connections, and the processes through which they are reproduced in everyday life.

The students will be introduced to the fundamental concepts, principles and theories in social psychology to then review these in light of the changing times that we live in. The course introduces the idea of social psychologies getting refracted in different social, political and cultural contexts as contrasted to a default universal social psychology. After setting the tone, the course discusses the research methods in social psychology critiquing some key studies as required, while also identifying the advances in social cognition through neuroscience research. The key elements of the study are individual cognition, affect and behavior in the implied and/or actual presence of others, interpersonal behavior- principles and theories therein, esp., focusing on pro-social behavior and aggression and group processes, where the key step level changes that happen in human behavior as a consequence of group affiliation. Throughout the course, applications in different contexts, with an interdisciplinary lens, are introduced and examined in detail. </span><br><br>

																In this survey course, we will explore topics in metaphysics and epistemology in the key texts of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Western philosophy. This period is the era of the emergence of the natural sciences, and several philosophical debates from this time remain influential in contemporary philosophy.
We will concern ourselves with the following questions: What is the ultimate structure of reality? How might we think of the nature, source and limits of knowledge? Can we rationally prove the existence of God? What is the nature of space and time? How does the mind relate to the body? What is the nature of personal identity? Are our actions really free? In addressing these questions, we will learn about a variety of philosophical positions like rationalism, empiricism, idealism, dualism, monism, and materialism.This course is open to all students. It is a core course for students pursuing a Minor in Philosophy.

Research is an attempt to understand the world through systematic study—that is, through identification of a problem, question, or hypothesis; selection of methods to investigate the question, collecting data, interpreting data, and reporting findings. The process of designing and doing research is a mix of various elements including the world view and social location of the researcher (researcher positionality), the selection of what one wants to investigate (research problem/question), and how one goes about doing it (research methods). This introductory and project-based course will familiarize students with the philosophical underpinnings of research, and enable them to identify, compare and contrast different qualitative and quantitative research methods suitable for answering a question, apply their understanding to design a research project in small groups, collect and analyse data, and demonstrate basics of academic writing.</span><br><br>

																Quantum computing is a rapidly emerging interdisciplinary field that draws from physics, mathematics, and computing. It has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of computation as we know it today.  Indeed, it has already been theoretically proved that for many applications quantum algorithms would be exponentially efficient than classical algorithms. This means quantum computers will be able to solve many problems that are practically intractable for classical computers. For example, quantum computes would be able to break all the existing public-key cryptographic algorithms used in online banking transactions. 
																																					
														        This course will provide an introduction to the mathematical framework of quantum computing. The focus will be on understanding how quantum algorithms work, although we will briefly discuss the physical realization of quantum computers towards the end of the course. Several important quantum algorithms will be discussed. Topics covered include quantum logic gates, quantum algorithms including the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, Shor's factoring algorithm, Grover's search algorithm, and optical photon quantum computer.

										<td><br><span> 																 																 																 																 																 																This course is a historical introduction to Islamic Philosophy (falsafah) and covers some of the key figures, major texts, and main themes of this intellectual tradition. The main focus of the course is on classical Islamic Philosophy from the early ninth century to the mid-seventeenth century. We study falsafah’s developments in this period with special attention to its interactions with two other important intellectual traditions in Islam, kalam (rational theology) and mysticism (especially Sufism). Some of the questions that we address here include: How can one rationally prove the existence of God? Is the nature of God’s knowledge different from our knowledge? What is happiness? What is the relationship between love and happiness? Do we need religion to live a good life? What constitutes our personal identity? Can we attain infallible knowledge? If yes, how is it possible? Is it attained through rational deliberation, mystical apprehension, or revelation? We also study some important contemporary Islamic schools of thought, Traditionalism, Reformism, and Islamic Feminism. In particular, we are interested to see whether the thinkers of these contemporary schools are simply continuing classical Islamic thought. If yes, in what sense are they contemporary? If no, what does make them different from their Muslim predecessors? This course is open to all students.

																This is an advanced course in exploring critical concepts in social theory. Important explanatory concepts such as representation, agency, class, caste, gender, modernity, intersectionality, state, subject-subjectivity, and identity among others will be explored in a historical and analytical dimension, such that students come to understand what is at stake in identifying (or not identifying) something as an instance of one of these concepts. The course will also introduce students to the history of debates surrounding these concepts such that they understand the contestations around their use. The course consists of four modules:

																What is the Global History Lab: Based in Princeton University, the Global History Lab is a platform for learning, skill development, and collaboration in the creation of new narratives across global divides. Using cutting-edge technologies, innovative pedagogical practices, and training in oral history methods, the GHL educates students about the history of globalisation and prepares them to become knowledge producers for a wider world. The program enlists universities and NGOs to engage in a new model of global education through peer-to-peer exchanges. It pushes the study and application of history into new humanitarian frontiers by integrating displaced peoples and refugees into its network.  It promotes human capabilities of understanding by developing narrative voices and listening skills between strangers.  The GHL is committed to the pursuit of the production of knowledge about the global past globally – in a way that is innovative, economical, and reaches across the world’s fractures.
The Global History Lab is an online course about world history from 1300 to the present. It has been a staple of the Princeton History Department curriculum for a quarter-century. A textbook has been written specifically for it; its textbook, Worlds Together, Worlds Apart: A History of Humankind from Origins to the Present (New York: W. W. Norton, 5th edition 2017) was co-authored by Princeton faculty and now serves as one of the leading manuals of world history. The course currently runs on the EdX platform. All one needs to enroll is an email address. A Teaching Fellow for the course has been arranged by Princeton University (Mr Neel Thakkar, a PhD student at Princeton, who has previous experience of Ahmedabad). The course is an opportunity for a small number of Ahmedabad University students (the upper limit is 24) to learn during the Monsoon Semester alongside students from global universities.
GHL Network: 
One of the principles of the course is to have teams of students engage with each other across borders, to learn the history of the world globally. Along the way, they learn about conflict and teamwork and connectedness. To that end, GHL relies on partners. Ahmedabad University is the only university in India to be approved as a partner. The current collaborators include: Fundación del Pino (Madrid, Spain), Panteion University (Athens, Greece), Potsdam University (Potsdam, Germany), Sciences Po (Paris, France), Al Quds University (East Jerusalem, Palestine), American University of Central Asia (Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan), Bard College Berlin (Berlin, Germany), Central European University (Vienna, Austria), European Humanities University (Vilnius, Lithuania), Fulbright University of Vietnam (Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam), Higher School of Economics (St Petersburg, Russia), American University of Nigeria (Wuro Hausa, Nigeria), American University of Iraq Suleimania (Suleimania, Iraq), Modern University of Business and Science (Beirut, Lebanon), Brac University (Daka, Bangladesh), Kiryandongo Settlement (Bweyale, Uganda), Kakuma & Dadaab Refugee Camps (Kenya), Sapienza University (Rome, Italy), University of Nigeria Ibadan (Ibadan, Nigeria), Los Andes University (Bogotá, Colombia), Tuskegee University (Tuskegee, US), Universidad Tres de Febrero (Buenos Aires, Argentina), Princeton University (Princeton USA). 
The Rationale: 
The Working Group on Global History at the School of Arts and Sciences at Ahmedabad University is interested in building an active platform where exchanges, collaborations, and resource development can occur with practitioners of global history from all over the world. And, in this regard, we find the core concerns of GHL – to consider global history as a form of dialogue to enable an inclusive and integrated world, and to engage with innovative pedagogical and research methods to do so – resonate strongly with our principal values.Course Description: This course takes the students on a voyage into the past. Like many of the explorers, they will meet along the way, they will travel across time from when Chinggis Khan’s armies conquered China and Baghdad in the 13th century and the Black Death scoured the Eurasian world a century later right up to the globalization of our day. Do earlier modes of globalization help us to understand our own age?  How can we understand old and new global divides? The dynamics of combinations, differences, and divisions are many: spiritual, economic, environmental, ideological, military, and political. This course aims to understand the big forces that pull the world’s parts together as well as those that drive them apart.  This course is also an experiment in humanitarian higher education. By connecting displaced people in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East with learners worldwide, it promotes a greater understanding of global integration and disintegration. It emphasizes collaboration across divides. Teams of students solve common historical problems and post their work in a shared gallery space. This course is unique not just in its scale and scope. We learn global history globally. This course connects students across 22 locations around the world, where students from various institutions are taking the same course simultaneously and posting and sharing their ideas on the course Gallery site.

																Philosophy of Psychology is an elective course for BA Psychology majors and can be taken to fulfil requirements for the Minor in Philosophy.
																																					
														        
Psychologists empirically study mind and behaviour while philosophers (of mind) conceptually analyse and develop arguments about the nature of mind/behaviour. However, there is a cross-pollination between Philosophy and Psychology. Often, the insights developed by philosophers guide the empirical work of psychologists, and similarly, the empirical findings of psychologists have implications for philosophical/theoretical accounts of mind/behaviour. In this spirit, this course discusses the broad theoretical and philosophical implications of the findings of Psychology, particularly with respect to the psychological processes of consciousness, thinking, rationality, free will, and social minds. However, it should be clarified that this course is distinct from traditional “Philosophy of Mind” courses which tend to focus on the fundamental nature of the mind; this course focuses on the empirical findings in Psychology and their theoretical (or philosophical) implications. The sample of the theoretical/philosophical implications of the empirical findings of Psychology include: (a) Do limited resource models of attention imply that we do not see everything that we could see? (b) Do we need language to think? (c) Do we possess the processes to acquire accurate knowledge about ourselves? (d) Why aren’t we always rational? (e) Do we have free will? and (f) What is the role of self-knowledge in understanding other minds?

										<td><br><span>As a way of knowing, science is taken to be the source of the most reliable knowledge that we have about the world and about ourselves. As an institution, it is one of the most powerful institutions in modern societies. It has a significant influence on our personal and social decisions and choices and it plays—or, at least, it is supposed to play—a major role in policymaking. But what exactly is this thing called “science”? Why is science taken to be so reliable? Do scientific theories describe reality as it is? If they do, why scientific theories have dramatically changed throughout the history of science? Do social, ethical, political, or economic values play a role in science? Should they? Who should decide what projects scientists are to work on? Scientists themselves? The government? Taxpayers?  These (and many other relevant) questions about science have been the subject-matter of important debates in philosophy of science. In these debates, various concepts and theories have been developed by philosophers of science to facilitate our understanding of different aspects of these questions. In this course, through a careful and critical examination of selected works in contemporary philosophy of science, we are going to discuss these concepts and theories and to find satisfactory answers for the questions. This course is offered at both 200 and 300 levels. It is a Major Elective for Science Major as well as PHL students.																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

																Theatre has evolved through time as an important tool of expression and communication.  It is not only a source of entertainment but can serve as a catalyst for social reform or development. Theatre also expands our connection to the larger world around us, and our empathy for lives lived differently from our own. A director or an actor thinks from the perspective of the diverse characters they portray, improving tolerance towards others in the society. The audience, in turn, becomes witness to worlds that they might otherwise not encounter or be familiar with. Studies have also shown that students who participate in theatre perform better in academics as it enhances their power to express themselves.This course aims to introduce students to the different forms and functions of theatre, inclusive of the wide range of roles theatre practitioners can take on, such as directing, acting and scriptwriting.  We will also simultaneously discuss how theatre relates to societal concerns, using theatre games to help students to find present day issues that are relevant to them. Importantly, we will work together on producing skits and script writing in peer groups to encourage students to work cohesively in groups, overcome their inhibitions and find the confidence to engage in creative self-expression.This course is at beginner level & doesn’t require prior theatre experience. It is open to all students at the University. It will run for  one session a week (for 3 hours) as in a lab course. It is offered by Kabir Thakore, the Director of the Scrapyard Theatre in Ahmedabad.

																Quantum computing is a rapidly emerging interdisciplinary field that draws from physics, mathematics, and computing. It has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of computation as we know it today. Indeed, it has already been theoretically proved that for many applications quantum algorithms would be exponentially efficient than classical algorithms. This means quantum computers will be able to solve many problems that are practically intractable for classical computers. For example, quantum computes would be able to break all the existing public-key cryptographic algorithms used in online banking transactions. 
																																					
														        This course will provide an introduction to the mathematical framework of quantum computing. The focus will be on understanding how quantum algorithms work, although we will briefly discuss the physical realization of quantum computers towards the end of the course. Several important quantum algorithms will be discussed. Topics covered include quantum logic gates, quantum algorithms including the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, Shor's factoring algorithm, Grover's search algorithm, and optical photon quantum computer.

										<td><br><span>Thinking and Reasoning is an elective course for BA Psychology majors and is mainly (but not exclusively) aimed at BA Psychology students. Also, any student who is interested in the psychology of thinking and reasoning (and fulfilled the prerequisite of Introduction to Psychology) can opt for this course. 

																					
														        
The capacities of thinking and reasoning set humans apart from all other living beings. Because of these capacities humans can imagine and make inferences not just about the perceived entities and events but also about the non-existent constructs. This course discusses the nature of the fundamental psychological processes behind human intellectual feats such as conceptual representation, imagination, moral reasoning, religious thinking, rational analysis, scientific thinking, etc.  
However, it should be clarified that this course is distinct from other courses like critical thinking and logical reasoning; Critical thinking and logical reasoning courses are concerned with “how ought one reason well” ―i.e., they have the normative concern― while this course is mainly concerned with “how do humans actually think and reason” ―i.e., it focuses on the descriptive concern― and thus discusses the psychological dynamics of thinking and reasoning along with the cognitive biases and errors that humans exhibit.
Though the primary objective of this course is to introduce the psychological processes involved in thinking and reasoning, the course will also cover various theoretical assumptions as well as the empirical findings pertaining to thinking and reasoning. Although this course mainly has a descriptive concern, the relevance and the practical applications of the theories and findings of the psychology of thinking and reasoning (as well as the remedies for the errors and biases in thinking and reasoning) will be discussed throughout the course.

The class will enable them to adopt a structured approach to working on their thesis by setting concrete deadlines with well-defined tasks for each week. This includes approaching and finalising a faculty advisor in the first month of the course, who will guide them towards relevant literature, approaches and methodology. The course will facilitate them  to reflect on their writing both in terms of its style and content. We will draw on texts that explain the skill-sets needed to enhance the practice of research and writing. The course will also help students develop as a collegial academic, able to engage with the works of their colleagues, provide constructive criticism and judiciously incorporate feedback from others into their work. By the end of the course they will have a proposal of a thesis or capstone project, with first drafts of each component of a thesis or a project, that they will continue to polish over the rest of the academic year.

Long-distance trade requires merchants to enter into exchange relationships with people from other cultures. Trade contacts facilitate reciprocal understanding by intersecting with myriad other aspects of human life including religious beliefs. Religion is often defined as a frozen set of precepts, rituals, and moral codes of behaviour. Contrary to this, religion in the early modern period (c. 1500 – c. 1800) exhibited an extraordinary dynamism and fluidity as it moved across geographies. By focusing on trade and religion in the Indian Ocean world, the course discusses the changing perceptions of different social groups as they came into closer contact. 

The Indian Ocean has been one of the oldest world regions that facilitated trade and cultural interactions. The exchange of goods, ideas, technologies, microbes, and plants was often mediated by merchants, mercenaries, and monks straddling across the Indian Ocean regions. In the early modern period, the diversity of peoples from Southeast Asia, South Asia, the Islamic heartlands, East Africa and Europe made the Indian Ocean an emerging globalising arena that brought multiple cultures and religions to closely interact. This led to the processes of identity formation, dissemination and adaptation of cultural practices, and contestations and compromises in forging an open, cosmopolitan society. Understanding this substratum of the historical past will enable us to better understand globalisation.

										<td><br><span>This course will focus on the fundamentals of drawing while emphasising its role in the act of mark-making as a primal instinct of human beings. While drawing is often seen as a primary tool supporting creative research within art practice, this course will also consider drawing as an independent and intimate approach that offers a keen insight to both the creative process and one’s emotional state. To that end, it is a studio-practice course aided by strong contextual studies that will enable students to develop basic rendering skills, understand drawing as a form of action and gesture that is an affirmation of life. Students will be able to objectively perceive the world we live in, which forms the crux of art-making in any art form – including printmaking, photography, painting, and digital art.
																					
														        																					
														        																					
														        																					
														        The studio sessions will be spent making drawings using representational, abstract, and non-representational approaches. There will be ongoing guidance and critique of works-in-progress, and discussions of finished works, which will touch upon concepts crucial to the creative process, including emphasis on hand-eye coordination, critical thinking, and spontaneity. This will also be supplemented with museum and gallery visits in the Ahmedabad city.
Sketchbooks will be an important component in this course; students will explore self-expression and alternative drawing methods as a part of their required initiative.
Students will complete this course with a strong understanding of what constitutes as drawing, and also develop technical skill and competency in the drawing process. The goal of this course is to perceive action and gesture as means to create art while also laying a strong foundation for anyone who wants to pursue other forms of art.</span><br><br>

																Ethics, as an area of philosophical inquiry, deals with the question of how we ought to act in any given situation. In this introductory course, we will explore a set of influential contemporary moral theories, and learn how these can be applied to some of the most pressing moral issues of our time. We will address some aspects of the following questions. Is there a criterion for distinguishing between right and wrong? Are morals culturally relative? What is the best human life? What might be the moral bases for accepting or rejecting practices like euthanasia, abortion, affirmative action, and civil disobedience? To what extent are we obligated to assist people in need? How ought we to treat animals? What might an ethical relationship between nations look like? Finally, we will discuss a subset of key ethical issues relating to the fields of engineering, business, neuroscience and psychology, and the natural and social sciences.

										<td><br><span>Migration is typically defined as a change in residence across administrative borders. What prompts people to leave home, whatever their attachments and grievances with “home” may be? How do they leave, where do they go and how do they make new homes in new places? Keeping in mind that capability to move differs, how does gender, class, caste, region, religion, and so on affect migration? How is the sociocultural and economic organisation of the origin and destination region refashioned through migration? These are some of the questions the course will ask students to engage with.
Since migration involves mobility between different systems of values, cultural politics is integral to migration. Cultural politics refers to struggles and contestations over social, economic and political values and meanings. For instance, gender norms vary between Saurashtra and Toronto and migrants have to work out ways of doing gender across the differences. The course uses cultural politics as a framing device to study migration.

The course design has two organising principles—one, census- based reasons for migration are used to structure the modules, and two, each module pays attention to diversity. The three reasons for migration that the census notes as prominent are marriage, work and education. The course has a module on each. Secondly, within each module, internal and international migration, gender (masculinity and femininity), and class (low- income and affluent) are covered. We will also consider how covid-19 lockdowns affected migration.

Students will be encouraged to engage with sub-areas and
themes not covered in the course content, like forced migration (refugees), the education of children of migrant households, and the impact of climate change on migration etc in their literature review and/or project. The instructor will provide additional materials based on student interest.</span><br><br>

In this practice-intensive seminar, we explore political psychology and some quantitive methods with specific attention to their subvert, generated, evolved understandings of politics, power, and its dynamics. Readings draws on exemplary political psychologies as well as discussions of quantitive methods and methodologies in social science. Students will have the opportunity to redesign political psychology research projects related to students' own primary areas of interests and will be expected to make significantly weekly commitments to R programming practices.

Making use of ethnographies, letters, memoirs, and autobiographies, students will engage writings on caste both as subject and method. What does it mean to write about caste in the contemporary? How do they inform one another? Rather than demonstrate a customary prevalence of caste in the present-day, the course explores the contours of contemporary theory the lens of caste. The experiential alongside anthropological modes of understanding serve as interrogative strands throughout the course. When it is not reduced to a singular concept around time, the contemporary becomes a unique vantage point to critically locate how we have come to inhabit the social and the ethical. Further, the course is designed to bring in global perspectives around caste and does not limit it to an isolated regional phenomenon.The course is valuable to students who are interested in questions around social hierarchy, ethics, and experience.</span><br><br>

This course provides an introduction to the complexities of animal behaviour, and how it is studied. Students will explore the various behaviours animals adopt in order to meet the challenges of their daily lives. We begin with how animals learn and communicate with each other, then move on to discuss how they find food, avoid predators, choose their mates, and rear their offspring. This course is aimed at anyone looking to broaden their understanding of animal behaviour beyond nature documentaries or a typical high school education. No previous knowledge is required, only curiosity and enthusiasm for the subject.</span><br><br>

Evolutionary Biology is the study of the changes in life forms over time - changes that have occurred over millions of years as well as those that have occurred over just a few decades. In this course, we will look at the various mechanisms of evolution, how these mechanisms work, and how change is measured. This course will begin by reviewing the evolutionary concepts of selection and speciation, phylogenetics and history of life. We will then learn natural selection and adaptation, evolutionary processes, and genes-genomes-phenotypes. The course will wrap up with a look at the evolution and modern society. At the end of this course, students will have a better understanding of the evolution of life. Also, this course will prepare students for future study and research in macroevolution, microevolution, genetics, behavioral biology, evolutionary medicine, and computational biology.																																					 																																			 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

PGMs bring together graph theory and probability theory and provide a flexible framework for modelling large collections of random variables with complex interactions.  The course will focus mainly on three aspects: A. The core representation, including Bayesian and Markov networks, and dynamic Bayesian networks; B. Probabilistic inference algorithms, both exact and approximate; and C. Learning methods for both the parameters and the structure of graphical models. Students entering the class should have a pre-existing working knowledge of probability, statistics, and algorithms. This class will set the foundation for machine learning, predictive analytics, reinforcement learning, natural language processing etc. Students can apply PGM in any field of core computer science and engineering to handle multidimensional uncertain problems.     																																					 																																			 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>
