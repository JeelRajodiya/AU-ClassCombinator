While quantitative methodologies and the need for big data drive research in Management studies, this course demonstrates how far business history is a truly global field, even while studying it from a national framework. To draw in-depth, fine-grained comparisons across different regions of the country, examining strategies of firms, states, and business associations, students stand to gain new perspectives into their own businesses while participating in current debates in adjacent fields such as political economy and global businesses.  This course on the history of Indian Business is multidisciplinary in its nature, where history and business are conjointly examined as important tools for understanding human nature and its past endeavors, throwing light on the present and future in many ways for the young managers/entrepreneurs.  By following a project based learning pedagogy, this course attempts at enabling students to understand history as contemporary, everyday lived experience.  </span><br><br>

																This is a seminar course to discuss scenarios of professional practice and ethical aspects in heritage management. This is designed specifically for the Heritage Management students, and is to be offered in the final semester of the programme. The idea behind this course is not to ‘teach’ a particular way of professional practice and or a set of ethics, but to make students aware of multiple fields of practice in different settings, and to sensitize them on potential roles, responsibilities, rights as well as ethical concerns that may come in such fields of practices – particularly keeping in mind their own scenarios or career plans as they graduate from the Masters degree in Heritage Management.Heritage is a broad concept connecting to various disciplines and almost all levels of society. Heritage Management is an evolving field of practice which aims to keep the heritage idea in focus while working in development, planning, economic activities, community development, research and institution building etc. Hence, there are multiple avenues of practice that the graduates of the Heritage management programme may pursue – from being an individual heritage professional to taking a leading position in a heritage related organization, from setting up their own entrepreneurial business to venturing into a large scale corporate type set up tapping into any sector of heritage, i.e. textile or metal work etc., from joining a government department to working in the NGO sector, from being an administrator in a local urban body to being an academician, and so on. Accordingly, it comes with its own complexities and potential conflicts of interests too. It is in such contexts that this course aims to highlight the potential overlaps, conflict of interests, individual and societal rights, organizational behavior and ethics etc. that may be relevant to heritage practitioners. This is not an exclusive course to cover all possible topics and areas – which perhaps is impossible, but this is a course to trigger such sensitivities in the minds of future heritage managers, and to enable them to explore such issues and be prepared to frame their career plan and professional activities in a more just and responsible ways.

Design is a set of activities and processes to bring about this improvement and beneficial change on their own. Design Thinking is a set of activities and processes to let design happen on its own. It is aimed at making designerly behaviour a very core mindset and bodyset.Design Thinking in the modern context is recognised as a core business activity which is capable of enhancing all activities around it, making them better and more human and consequently profitable as well. Over the years, it has developed as a very robust and ever-evolving combination of design, science, human behaviour and business principles. At the centre of this is the target user for whom systems are built to understand them, empathise with them define their problems and help them solve these problems through strategically targeted design interventions. Ultimately, all business is about the people who invest in it through one or the other level of consumer behaviour. Design Thinking is aimed at giving business thinkers, a very deeply strategic advantage in the market.The proposed course is an introduction to Design Thinking which is delivered through a set of 14 sessions, discussions, and structured assignments that help internalise these basic concepts. Several minor assignments and a major project serve as a vehicle for participative action that is central to the understanding of Design Thinking as applied to imaginative business models while understanding four key aspects – context, intent, recipients of the design and the system involved.</span><br><br>

														        Human resource management is the process of gaining a competitive advantage through people. Organizational performance is driven by people, and it depends on certain measures. Human Resource (HR) experts need to be skilled at planning and interpreting organizations' people metrics. This requires a solid understanding of HR analytics, i.e., the systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of data considered to improve decisions about talent and moreover the organization at large. The application of analytics is changing the way HR managers quantify the value that people (i.e., talent) - a company’s biggest asset - have on the organization's ability to succeed in the market or in its mission. For enabling managers to make smart decisions about talent, HR needs to effectually leverage data. When equipped with metrics that are suitably designed and easy to interpret, HR can render managers with analytics to make decisions which will not only improve operations nonetheless also create systemic advantages. Data and sophisticated analysis are brought in the dynamics to effectively handle people-related issues viz., recruiting, hiring and promotion, performance evaluation, leadership, collaboration, job design, and compensation. The curriculum is of an introductory nature to the theory of people analytics. It is not intended to prepare learners to perform complex talent management data analysis. At the conclusion of this course, you will be able to understand that how and when hard data is operated to make soft-skill decisions about hiring and talent development; therefore, you may level yourself as a strategic partner in the company’s talent management decisions. The course will help students in three distinct ways. One, it will provide students with the latest grounding in current evidence on managing people, providing a knowledge base which shall ensure that their future management is led by the best practices. Second, develop the understanding and skills that are necessary to be thoughtful, critical consumers of data on people management, allowing them to make an in-depth analysis as they make people decisions. Third, provide direction and practice in conducting people analytics, preparing students to gather their own data, and making students more skilled analysts. These goals will be pursued through a mixture of case discussion, lecture, and hands-on exploration of a variety of data sets. The course is intended to introduce you to the fact that Organizations flourish when the people who work in them flourish. Analytics can help make both happen.</span><br><br>

It is also important for individuals who create any original work, be it in the scientific, literary, or cultural domain. Intellectual property rights are considered monopolistic rights, but the monopoly is a limited one as the IPRs will go in the public domain after a certain stipulated time. The ethical implications of the IPRs will be discussed and deliberated during the course through various case studies where monopolistic presence versus the social benefits are in conflict especially pharmaceutical products and/or utilitarian goods. The course will familiarize students with the popular types of intellectual properties and the legal provisions related to them and the administrative remedies which can be sought for. With the advent of technology, intellectual property protection has become a challenge due to piracy.

In this context, the key challenges for cultural organisations are to: • be agile in the changing and fluid environment;  • achieve and sustain innovation over time; and  • maintain and increase their visitors and networks, securing financial viability and also contributing to the development of the local and the broader community.  A wide range of cultural organisations, international and Asian and Indian ones, from both the public and the private sector are used as case studies.

Such cause-and-effect questions on “Does X cause Y, or is X just correlated with Y?” are very relevant and come up in discussions in our day-to-day lives. However, the appropriate answer to such questions is very policy-relevant. Therefore, it requires a good understanding of the difference between correlation and causality and the methods that help differentiate between the two ideas. This course is essentially about learning how to find appropriate answers to the above questions.

In this course, students will learn the counterfactual model of causality, enabling them to identify the causal mechanisms that influence the relationship between two variables. For most of the course, students will receive an intuitive and theoretical understanding of the applied (microeconometric) research methods, followed by their applications through research papers and their practice in STATA. At the end of this course, students should be able to apply these methods to their research ideas and the corresponding data from any particular field of interest (development, education, health, labour, environment, finance, management, etc.).</span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>Of late, ‘Business Valuation’ has gained tremendous prominence due to various judicial pronouncements in India and abroad. In India, a new professional discipline on Valuation has been created through 2017-Valuation Rules and by setting up of Registered Valuers Organisations (RVO) for all purpose valuation. By its nature, valuation is not a precise science due to imperfections in the market and varying perceptions. A valuer may have perfect knowledge of the market but the market may not have perfect knowledge of the value. On every occasion there may not be a definitive value conclusion, but every valuation exercise is based on its circumstances and premise. There is nothing called correct valuation; valuation is an opinion and therefore, the principle of caveat applies. Valuation exercise needs methodical & logical approaches, careful application of the basic valuation principles and adherence to standards and practices. Therefore, a valuation professional needs to be better educated in order to make business valuation theories & practices better explained and better defined in the context. This course deals with various methods and techniques (comprising all the three internationally accepted approaches) of valuation to suit various purposes of valuation, following valuation standards, principles and regulations of the country. Emphasis is given on practical application of the concepts. </span><br><br>

																Heritage is not only about the past; heritage management is not only about preserving, and ‘freezing’, the past in the present. Heritage is also living, continuing and evolving into the present and the future; and heritage management is also about sustaining continuity and managing evolution. 
																																					
														        Within this framework, ‘living heritage approach’ (LHA) is an approach to heritage management that: 
• sees heritage as part of the identity of the contemporary local communities; 
• empowers local communities in the heritage management process, recognizing their traditional knowledge, management systems and maintenance practices; and
• links heritage management to sustainable development, by making heritage relevant to the socio-economic needs of the contemporary local communities. 
LHA could be considered an innovative approach in the sense that it is different from, and moves beyond, values-based approach – i.e. the current most preferred approach to heritage management, adopted, and advocated by major conservation authorities, both at national level (e.g., USA, Canada, Australia, and UK) and at international level (e.g., UNESCO World Heritage Centre), and by major research and educational institutions (e.g., the Getty).
LHA is of international scope, yet of particular relevance to the Asian and Oceanic and the Indian context, and specifically to the World Heritage City of Ahmedabad, respecting the local religious and cultural traditions and bringing significant benefits to the local communities.
The course: 
• presents the key characteristics and the planning process methodology for the application of the LHA;
• examines the application of the LHA in a wide range of heritage sites such as religious sites and historical towns and villages; and
• highlights the contribution of the LHA to reconciling development/energy infrastructure to heritage sites and local communities.
A wide range of heritage sites, international and Asian-Oceanic and Indian ones, are used as case studies.
The ultimate aim of the course is to help current and potential heritage managers understand the importance and develop methodologies of involving, and empowering, local community and civil society members in the heritage management process. Above all, the course encourages current and potential heritage managers to adopt a new ‘paradigm’ that would recognize the local communities as the long-term custodians of their heritage and themselves as the supporters and mediators – towards the continual creation of heritage in the present and the future. 
The course addresses undergraduate and postgraduate students interested in heritage sites (religious sites, historical towns and villages) and local communities, and in tourism.

										<td><br><span>Brands exist in the consumers’ minds and yet entice them to act as if it were a relationship of the heart.Brands often look for top-of-mind recall, but branding is an emotional connection that the audience forms with the brand and its message thereby creating a loyal following. It is not what you think and says but what they (the audience) perceive and believe. Therefore, branding is a function of strategy and psychology that embeds various facets of design in it.This course is designed to cover the fundamentals of branding and packaging to sensitize you to the decision-making process required to create a cohesive brand language. In a world dominated by brands, it is important to understand the key differentiating factor and then build an experience around it. Strategic Packaging design directly contributes to building a brand image by functional or aesthetic elements or by reinforcement of brand image by giving out an experience. This course will offer the tools and techniques required to formulate the right strategy for success.The pedagogy consists of interactive sessions with a healthy mix of fundamental theory, case studies, on the spot, and group assignments for hands-on learning.Your key takeaway from this course will be the ability to make smart decisions for building a successful brand image and a long-term plan for a lasting brand impression.</span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>Interaction design is the practice of designing interactive digital products, environments, systems, and services.Ideally, interacting with technology would be as easy and intuitive as interacting with other humans. So, why do so many products and services fail to achieve this ideal? All products, whether digital or otherwise, must deliver a high-quality user experience or risk losing users to competitors.The focus of interaction design is on user-centred design based on the understanding of real users including their experiences, goals, needs, wants and tasks. The goal of interaction design is also to collect and analyse data to make informed interface design decisions which are critical to creating and delivering successful products, services and systems that fulfil the user/customer, technological and business needs. </span><br><br>

It brings the power of computational analysis to problems and possibilities in humanities and related disciplines. This course aims to inform students of transdisciplinary research being undertaken within the purview of DH to equip them with the ability to hypothesise and 'critically-make' new media projects.The students are expected to incorporate a 50:50 ratio in their study of theory and implementing solutions hands-on. Students will be guided to prototype solutions that bridge their primary field of study with the Humanities. The course will result in the culmination of a final project answering a research question. Students will engage closely in a project that results in the culmination of a DH-platform as part of their evaluation.The tools that will primarily be used are Python, Google Collab, miscellaneous OpenAccess methods for text, network, spatial analyses will be encouraged. Students need not have any prior knowledge of these tools to register for this course. The coursework would broadly involve the creation of a data essay, a piece of alternative or multimodal writing and towards the development of an OpenAccess digital platform to highlight digital scholarship in Indian galleries, libraries, archives and museums (GLAM) for he general public.</span><br><br>

An organization with a project culture is one that knows where it is going, is focused on results and has a professional team who knows what is expected of them. Professionals & organizations working or desiring to start a new venture in diverse fields require an understanding and insight of Project Management concepts and methods. Projects are vital and often businesses and various functions start with this management operation. Initial activities within a function also start with projects, for e.g. Launching a new product in the market or implementing ERP within the organisation. The products are developed at lab scale, tried at pilot scale and produced at plant scale.  To handle all these activities later in their careers, management students have to learn Project Management techniques and through planning and control techniques to execute projects.</span><br><br>

Does the COVID19 shock have a transitory or persistent effect on macroeconomic indicators like economic growth, unemployment, interest rates and inflation?

Such behaviour of economic as well as financial variables is studied in detail in time series econometrics. The above questions are a few examples in this regard. This course goes beyond the traditional use of time series analysis to forecast the time path of a variable. It is extremely relevant to decompose a series into deterministic and stochastic components for making forecasts, interpretation of economic data, drawing causal inferences and the direction of causality. The serial dependence structure demonstrates a difference equation with both deterministic and stochastic components, whose solution(s) yields a time path of a single series or a vector of many interdependent series.
This advanced graduate course will familiarise students with modelling and forecasting of time series data. It will expose them to the basic techniques of time series econometric analyses and its applications in economics and finance. The course is designed to provide hands-on training in econometric software(s) such as R, which is an open source free software to critically analyse and investigate pertinent empirical questions in the real world.

Although India is a small market for luxury goods currently (projected value of $8.5 billion in 2023), according to this report, it could reach up to $200 billion by 2030. Apple opened two stores in India this year, Louis Vuitton roped in Deepika Padukone as its first-ever Indian house ambassador, Gucci appointed Alia Bhatt as its first global ambassador from India, and Dior held its first-ever fashion show in India. These and other developments show that the Indian luxury market is ready to take off. This has been possible because of a large number of young, educated, and economically well-off Indian consumers who are exposed to global luxury brands and want to enjoy and showcase their success by buying luxury goods.

In this course, Marketing Luxury Brands, the students will learn to analyze and understand the marketing mix applied to managing luxury brands. Students will learn about the sociological and psychological factors that shape the behavior of luxury consumers. They will learn what makes a product a luxury brand, where these brands are sold, and how the messaging is different for luxury brands. This course also has a set of case studies that will help the students learn to analyze real-world marketing scenarios involving luxury brands.

During  the past few years the concept of Global Commons has extended  from  Climate and Biodiversity to  include global peace, zoonotic global pandemics like  COVID 19 , Arts and Heritage and  the global financial order. A classic case of the importance of global peace as a Global Commons is that of the volatile situation created by North Korea and the Russian invasion of Ukraine  which has had ramifications across the world by way of biodiversity loss , climate change ,global recession, oil price hikes. The  importance of multilateral and bilateral negotiations to resolve these issues  has been crucial. Meanwhile international financing agencies such as the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, the European Investment Bank and the Global Environmental Facility have developed  portfolios on climate change and biodiversity by way of direct investments and transfer of new patented technologies in low carbon technologies. The other significant development has been the advent  of digital ledgers like Block chains and AI and the metaverse which have found applications in the management of these global commons. </span><br><br>

It aims to build upon the important accounting concepts and principles including revenue recognition, inventory, depreciation, and understanding the accounting equation. The course focuses initially on how to record economic events in the accounting records (i.e., bookkeeping and accrual accounting) and how to prepare and interpret the primary financial statements that summarize a firm's economic transactions (i.e., the balance sheet, the income statement, and the statement of cash flows). The course adopts a decision-maker perspective of accounting by emphasizing the relation between accounting data and the underlying economic events that generated them thereby enabling the students to read, understand and analyse financial statements through ratio analysis. The course also explores the areas of financial shenanigans wherein the students will be able to learn how companies use financial statements to disguise economic reality.</span><br><br>

In this sense, organisations are not merely seen as a place where communication happens, but it exists because employees communicate and create the sense in the existing structure. Also, the idea of the workplace has moved beyond the simple "office space" to "living social networks" that combine work, home and play. Moreover, organisations use their website and social media to communicate with internal and external stakeholders. Viewed, thus, in this context, the course looks at the constitutive view of communication and intends to familiarise students with workplace communications as practised in the corporate world. The course is interdisciplinary and involves the combination of concepts (communication, sociology and computer-mediated technology) into one project. </span><br><br>

In doing so, students are introduced to the different types of derivatives instruments that are available in the market place, their utility, and the attendant market structures and price mechanisms pertaining to such derivative instruments. Further, students are exposed to pertinent risk management strategies that can be undertaken by market participants at different levels of the value chain so as to mitigate different risks. 																	 The 1991 big bang reforms in general and the financial sector reforms in particular, among many things, led to the establishment of cutting-edge state-of-the-art institutions such as National Stock Exchange (NSE) and National Securities Clearing Corporation Limited (NSCCL; now renamed as NSE Clearing Limited.), which in turn have played an instrumental role in development of vibrant derivatives market in India. This has catapulted India in global league when it comes to derivatives trading activity. Consequently, this course is also geared to making students appreciate the opportunities and challenges with respect to Indian derivative markets, without losing sight of the regulatory actions that have enabled the prevalence of derivatives market in the first place.   </span><br><br>

The course shifts away from the individual level to the group, and organizational levels of behavior drawing on concepts and practices from the field of Organizational Behavior (OB). This course provides a basic understanding of your own and others’ behavior, particularly in teams. It enhances your ability to communicate and work effectively with others.  Organization requires effective management of people and a clear understanding of human behavior and social processes. Managers need to have a good understanding both of themselves and of those whom they will lead.

										<td><br><span>In the contemporary age of increasing integration among the economies of the world, questions such as why and how countries trade with one another, how international capital flows are decided, how do indigenous firms compete against the mighty multinational corporations, the relevance of interest and inflation rate differentials, how the international value of currency gets decided, and many more, call for the attention of students of Economics. Answers to these questions are not simple, and there scarcely exists a unique solution for any one of them. Nevertheless, principles of Economics, both Micro and Macro, often provide an interesting and effective framework on which the logic of international economic issues can be constructed.  																																					 														         International Economics provides an insight into some of these principles and equips undergraduate students in the field of management with the understanding of the functioning of the economies in a globalized world. The course covers essential theories of International Economics as well as empirical analysis of some of the most important global events that have altered the way in which economies have functioned over the last few decades. </span><br><br>

Understanding consumer behaviour needs an interdisciplinary approach – concepts and methods from several disciplines like neuromarketing, cognitive psychology, behavioural economics, anthropology, sociology, and more. Consumers often make irrational choices. Decisions are based on emotions and unconscious motivations – not only on rational logic. Consumer choices are implicit not explicit. Consumers cannot often express their motivations in response to traditional marketing research surveys. This is because consumers either won’t say why they made some choices (as the answers might not sound logical and reasonable) or they can’t say (as choices were made at an unconscious level and they themselves do not know why they choose a brand). The course will draw on the works of several neuroscientists and behavioural economists like Daniel Kahneman, Richard Thaler, and Dan Ariely. We will use behavioural economics experiments (‘Nudge’ as Richard Thaler calls it) to see how subtle interventions influence brand choices. We will explore how ethnography – a method of immersing oneself in consumer lives (used in anthropology and sociology) – can help us get under the skin of the consumer and observe the role of products and brands in consumer life, as lived and not as claimed in surveys. 																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

The intent is to give a foundation in design to students enrolled in any programme at the University by exposing them to the basic design fundamentals - principles, methods, processes and approaches. The course will expose the students to the user-centric approach that design adopts to address local and global challenges. They will learn to recognise that design is exploratory in nature and helps navigate ambiguity. It promotes new ways of looking at problems and coming up with solutions which are human-centered and inclusive.With practical exercises, the course will give an overview of the critical design thinking used for problem identification and opportunity mapping in any given context. Students will gain an understanding of design as a creative problem-solving tool to come up with holistic solutions for products, services, systems and experiences. The course is expected to rouse a student’s interest in design. It will equip them with the necessary grounding to pursue design as a higher education or career pathway. Importantly, it will add a richer and diverse perspective to their understanding of their own field of Major education be it management, technology, sciences, humanities or social sciences.This course is open for students who are admitted to any programme at the University</span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>Visual/Creative communication in the digital age requires familiarisation and literacy that goes way beyond – beyond traditional practices. Digital is no longer a grey area. It becomes inevitable that the brand language be effectively transformed from one media to another without changing the brand image. Throughout this course, the focus would be to expose students to ideas, applications, experiences and opportunities that are relevant to today’s times. This course is primarily about creating visual artefacts that communicate effectively, but that does not mean you need to be an artist to succeed. Assessment will focus upon your efforts and your willingness to engage with your classmates to provide feedback and learn from one another. The more time you spend with the exercises in this course, the more skills you will develop as a visual communicator. Take the time to explore each exercise, take risks, and reiterate often. Don’t allow your first attempt at any solution to be your only attempt. Fail early and fail often. Learning what doesn’t work is an essential process in understanding what does work. This course is open for students who are admitted to any programme at the University.    </span><br><br>

Operational excellence is critical for success in many service industries today, global competition and rapidly evolving information technology. However, understanding service operations is not easy. Services are intangible, highly variable, not storable or transportable and often involve distributed operations with a significant amount of customer contact. This means that most service operations look quite different than manufacturing operations, and they often require specialized analytical frameworks and tools.

The above questions are a few examples in this regard. This course goes beyond the traditional use of time series analysis to forecast the time path of a variable. It is extremely relevant to decompose a series into deterministic and stochastic components for making forecasts, interpretation of economic data, drawing causal inferences and the direction of causality. The serial dependence structure demonstrates a difference equation with both deterministic and stochastic components, whose solution(s) yields a time path of a single series or a vector of many interdependent series.This advanced undergraduate course will familiarise students with modelling and forecasting of time series data. It will expose them to the basic techniques of time series econometric analyses and its applications in economics and nance. The course is designed to provide hands-on training in econometric software(s) such as R, which is an open source free software to critically analyse and investigate pertinent empirical questions in the real world.</span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>Human resource management is the process of gaining a competitive advantage through
people. Organizational performance is driven by people, and it depends on certain measures.
Human Resource (HR) experts need to be skilled at planning and interpreting organizations'
people metrics. This requires a solid understanding of HR analytics, i.e., the systematic
collection, analysis, and interpretation of data considered to improve decisions about talent
and moreover the organization at large. The application of analytics is changing the way HR
managers quantify the value that people (i.e., talent) - a company’s biggest asset - have on the
organization's ability to succeed in the market or in its mission. For enabling managers to make
smart decisions about talent, HR needs to effectually leverage data. When equipped with
metrics that are suitably designed and easy to interpret, HR can render managers with
analytics to make decisions which will not only improve operations nonetheless also create
systemic advantages. Data and sophisticated analysis are brought in the dynamics to
effectively handle people-related issues viz., recruiting, hiring and promotion, performance
evaluation, leadership, collaboration, job design, and compensation.
The curriculum is of an introductory nature to the theory of people analytics. It is not intended
to prepare learners to perform complex talent management data analysis. At the conclusion of
this course, you will be able to understand that how and when hard data is operated to make
soft-skill decisions about hiring and talent development; therefore, you may level yourself as a
strategic partner in the company’s talent management decisions.
The course will help students in three distinct ways. One, it will provide students with the latest
grounding in current evidence on managing people, providing a knowledge base which shall
ensure that their future management is led by the best practices. Second, develop the
understanding and skills that are necessary to be thoughtful, critical consumers of data on
people management, allowing them to make an in-depth analysis as they make people
decisions. Third, provide direction and practice in conducting people analytics, preparing
students to gather their own data, and making students more skilled analysts. These goals will
be pursued through a mixture of case discussion, lecture, and hands-on exploration of a variety
of data sets. The course is intended to introduce you to the fact that Organizations flourish
when the people who work in them flourish. Analytics can help make both happen.</span><br><br>

It is for this reason that we must learn the environmental issues. Environment is not yesterday’s concern, it is today’s worry on how to make it more sustainable without over-exploitation of natural resources and destructions of ecosystems. This course shall include topics on ecology, biodiversity, conservation, pollution, climate change, and environmental policies and laws. The best way to learn about the environment is to learn from events that are happening around us. Thus, the course is aimed at discussing each topic on environment by bringing in examples that are based in the Indian context. 																																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

										<td><br><span> 																																					 														        Conventional wisdom associates ‘development’ with industrialisation. We often talk of ‘industrialised’ and ‘developed’ countries in the same breath. But what exactly constitutes industrialisation? What effects does it have on the structure of society? How is it related to science, technology and business? Is industrialisation driven from above (by governments) or from below (by entrepreneurs)? These questions are particularly important today as we face climate change and other environmental challenges.Such questions will be explored in this course through the history of industrialisation in several locations including Britain, continental Europe (especially Germany), the USA, Japan and India. A broad time-period will be covered, starting with the Industrial Revolution in eighteenth-century Britain and coming down to the present day. This is in accordance with newer approaches to the study of industrialisation, which look at the phenomenon on a global scale, rather than focusing on a few (Western) countries (Stearns 2012).</span><br><br>

MUS101 tries to address these questions by exploring and interrogating the existing genres of Indian Music like Tribal-Folk, Classical-Art, Popular, Devotional and Fusion Music. It focuses on the key principles of music that formulate these genres and connect them to each other, the connection which eventually weaves the complex and diverse fabric called ‘Indian Music’. The course also tries to understand the relationship of culture and music through the dynamics of above mentioned genres. This course combines Theory and Practice thus students are expected to perform some vocals and also do some writing during the course. </span><br><br>

																This course introduces students to some of the most influential theories and philosophies that have informed the study and writing of history. Students will learn a variety of theoretical and historical perspectives for viewing the world and thinking about historical studies, in general. 
Students will explore the development of historical understanding and the various problems and approaches to the study of history. Student will read, discuss, and write about some of the most important works of theory and historiography. As E.H. Carr tells us, “interpretation enters into every fact of history.” Yet, historians often disagree about those interpretations. Through this course, students will recognize the ways in which those disagreements are often rooted in conflicting perspectives about the nature of reality, forms of power, human nature, and truth. 
We discuss a different theme each week including post-colonialism, gender, memory, and ‘universal’ history; and engage with major thinkers such as Hegel and Marx. 
Normally, the class reads one essay per session in order to give it close attention, but longer essays may be spread across two class meetings. A typical class meeting consists of a lecture, reading together as a class, and discussion. Students should expect to read 30-40 pages per week.

										<td><br><span>This course on brain and behaviour is primarily aimed at satisfying a core requirement for the psychology programme. This is the biological psychology core. It is aimed at second-year students who have no biology background beyond basic school biology. The required background will be provided as additional study material in the first two weeks of class. While psychology students are the main audience, the course serves as an introduction to neuroscience for the non-biologist and biologist alike. Thus, it is offered through the biological and life sciences programme, and will additionally serve as a campus-wide general education requirement (GER) in biology.  
Brain and Behaviour explores the physiological basis for psychological processes. Broadly this is the link between brain (the biological substrate) and certain functions of the brain. The course will cover innate and motivated behaviours, including sensation, motion, reproductive behaviours, perception, emotions, cognition, learning, memory, and language. Although our focus will be the “human brain” other species, especially rodents and non-human primates, will be considered for comparison. The course will provide enough knowledge of biological mechanisms, with an emphasis on neural and endocrine function, as they apply to psychology and the mind-brain connection. Through this understanding, and through an understanding of various imbalances in physiology, genetics, and biological development, students will gain an understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying normal behaviour and some of its abnormalities.

Cities are where future challenges lie, making them sites for various interdisciplinary investigations as well as solutions for human wellbeing and environmental sustainability. Today, more than half the world population lives in cities, creating the need for grounding of all social sciences, physical sciences, and professional works within the cities. Cities are spaces of opportunities as well as challenges given that there is no turning back the clock of history. Grounded within the Indian context, this course is divided into three broad segments that: one introduces students to important concepts and frameworks through which to understand various facets of a city; two introduces the challenges facing contemporary Indian cities and three unpack these challenges from the vantage of specific groups in the cities so as to move towards initial solutions. The challenges are presented through case studies and are related to the everyday living of urban residents with respect to employment and poverty, health, infrastructure, housing, ecology and pollution, climate change impacts, crime and violence and inequality. 
The course attempts to sensitise students to these challenges experienced by different populations in a city and solutions they bring on board. The sequel to this course would be towards systemic as well as decentralised solutions within the domains of urban planning and governance.  This course and its sequel will be of interest to the students thinking of future careers in urban management, urban and/ or development policies, climate change solutions, public health, media and social work sector.

How have classical theories conceptualised the state and society? How is the historical evolution of the state and society in the West different from the way they have evolved in the Global South, especially in India? The big transformations in information technology and capitalism in the 21st century have fundamentally impacted the state and social interactions. Through a focus on theory and empirical studies, the course explores five key themes or dimensions of the state-society interaction: 1. What is the state?; 2. What is society?; 3. Civil Society, social movements and citizenship; 4. Sociality and politics in the age of internet; 5. State, market society and neoliberalism.   The course will explore the following questions pertaining to its five themes: 1.	What are the important theoretical perspectives about the state (Weberian and Marxist)? How is the state experienced in the everyday lives of people in India?  2.	What does social theory tell us about the fundamental elements of society and social life (Emile Durkheim)? What are the dominant features of pre and post-independent Indian society? 3.	What is civil society and does it always strengthen democracy? How do social movements challenge the existing status quo of the state and society and when do they fail to do so?  4.	How has digital media technology transformed classical notions of the public sphere and what are its implications for social relations and harmony?   5.	What is market society and how has market thinking permeated social lives? What is the history and rise of neoliberalism and why is it best understood as a political project? </span><br><br>

In this process, context factors are of crucial importance on account of the social, historical, and ecological distinctiveness of human experiences. In light of this understanding, Developmental Psychology takes an integrative perspective on multi-domains such as physical and motor coordination, social relationships formations and social knowledge, emotions, and cognition such as language acquisition. Furthermore, the study of development is understood in specific contexts like family, schools, peer groups, neighborhoods and society, looking both at normative as well as idiographic patterns. Issues of developmental difference and disability will also be addressed with focus on individually and systematically appropriate interventions.  																 																 																																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

										<td><br><span> 																 																 																 																This undergraduate course is a survey of empire in Indian history. It focuses on the historical experiences of empire, the self-image and ideologies of the political elites, and their dealings with the diverse groups of people and the local-level power holding communities. How did the entanglements between ruling elites and subject population help Indians to imagine themselves and their position in the world? The course further discusses the territory, trade routes, taxation or resource extraction, and redistribution. Furthermore, what role did the natural environment, political culture and institutions, and different communities play in the emergence and the functioning of empire? Finally, it asks how Indian society has been shaped by the collective memories and legacies of empire. Introducing the substrata of India’s political and economic past, it discusses key themes around the state formation and empire building processes.  																																					 														         The term empire acquired a negative connotation thanks to the British colonial high-handedness and the bitter experiences of decolonisation movements. However, the empire that Indians knew, lived in and experienced was not necessarily bad. For a long span of time, over the last two millennia, Indians lived and worked within one or the other empire. Compared with the long history of empire, the modern nation state is new. It is an adapted concept from nineteenth-century Europe. In several respects, the nation state appears to be lacking in meeting the demands of a “civilisation-state” i.e. India with its enormous diversity.  Discussion of empire and institutions can help form a more nuanced understanding the contemporary Indian society.     																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

Cities are where future challenges lie, making them sites for various interdisciplinary investigations as well as solutions for human wellbeing and environmental sustainability. Today, more than half the world population lives in cities, creating the need for grounding of all social sciences, physical sciences, and professional works within the cities. Cities are spaces of opportunities as well as challenges given that there is no turning back the clock of history. Grounded within the Indian context, this course is divided into three broad segments that: one introduces students to important concepts and frameworks through which to understand various facets of a city; two introduces the challenges facing contemporary Indian cities and three unpack these challenges from the vantage of specific groups in the cities so as to move towards initial solutions. The challenges are presented through case studies and are related to the everyday living of urban residents with respect to employment and poverty, health, infrastructure, housing, ecology and pollution, climate change impacts, crime and violence and inequality. 

The course attempts to sensitise students to these challenges experienced by different populations in a city and solutions they bring on board. The sequel to this course would be towards systemic as well as decentralised solutions within the domains of urban planning and governance.  This course and its sequel will be of interest to the students thinking of future careers in urban management, urban and/ or development policies, climate change solutions, public health, media and social work sector.

Students who are taking a minor in philosophy may also use it to meet their philosophy credit requirements.In the course, we will engage in a close reading of one of the most influential philosophical texts of the 20th century, Thomas Kuhn’s The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (SSR), originally published in 1962. Sessions will primarily consist in detailed reading and discussing the revolutionary importance of SSR, especially in our understanding of science. We will also supplement our reading of this book by looking at a selection of important articles which address some of the focal themes, concepts, and arguments of SSR. The course aims thereby to prepare students for advanced research in the humanities, while illustrating the dynamic processes through which classic philosophical texts are taken up and transform our understanding of a subject (in this case science) in philosophy and beyond.
Note: While the focal text and instructor for PHL 301 is subject to change from year to year, the basic structure of the course will remain constant, and a similar session plan will be followed.</span><br><br>

Research is an attempt to understand the world through systematic study—that is, through identification of a problem, question, or hypothesis; selection of methods to investigate the question, collecting data, interpreting data, and reporting findings. The process of designing and doing research is a mix of various elements including the world view and social location of the researcher (researcher positionality), the selection of what one wants to investigate (research problem/question), and how one goes about doing it (research methods). This introductory and project-based course will familiarize students with the philosophical underpinnings of research, and enable them to identify, compare and contrast different qualitative and quantitative research methods suitable for answering a question, apply their understanding to design a research project in small groups, collect and analyse data, and demonstrate basics of academic writing.</span><br><br>

It is a survey course that extensively reviews the various aspects of the British colonial rule over the Indian subcontinent. The period covered is roughly between 1850s to 1940s. In the first couple of weeks, we will acquaint ourselves with the state and society in the Indian subcontinent before the advent of the colonial rule. However, the bulk of the course will examine in detail the impact of British imperial rule on India. We will explore the major political, social and cultural events with a focus on three themes: Caste, Print media and Nation. We will examine the emergence of caste as a form of politics; as an ideological battle-ground; and as a discourse. We will also engage with different vernacular publics that emerged through the rise of print in the nineteenth century India to explore the circulation and dissemination of the idea of the Indian nation. Gender and religion will be some of the other overlapping themes we will explore.

process of developing a sustainable environment is complex, and requires understanding of natural, constructed and
cultural environments. The course on ‘Fundamentals of Environmental studies’ employs a multidisciplinary approach
to understand the environment from various disciplines, biology, engineering, social sciences, and management. This
course shall include topics on concepts of biosphere, natural heritage, climate change, community participation
towards conservation efforts, conservation politics, criteria for developing effective environmental policies, and
remedial measures to mitigate environmental problems. To provide real-world context, the course will include and
discuss several case-studies on environmental issues and concerns that India is currently facing. The course will be offered to both graduate and undergraduate students. Besides the prescribed evaluation
components, the graduate students will need to submit an additional term paper on an issue pertaining to the recent
environmental problems.</span><br><br>

The course will explore this question of how phenomenal experience emerges from the physical stimulation of senses by light, sound, pressure and chemicals in the environment. We have specialised systems to process diverse forms of sensory information. The stimulation by light activates the visual system, and sound engages the auditory system, and so on. The course will track the entire process of perception, from the stimulation of the sensory receptors to the emergence of conscious experience. Students will learn the fundamentals of sensory transduction, neural coding of sensory information, and higher-order processes responsible for assimilating and interpreting sensory information. The students will then use this knowledge to read and reflect on research in the field of perception as well as use the conceptual knowledge towards tangible outcomes. The course will draw ideas from psychophysics, neuroscience, artificial intelligence and philosophy on perceiving the world around us.</span><br><br>

Elementary ideas from Differential Geometry are used in many fields of learning such as Robotics, Elasticity, Mechanics, Statistical Physics, Relativity and Cosmology,         This course is a first introduction to some of the main ideas of Differential Geometry-including Manifolds, Tangent Space, Curvature, Local and Global theory of Curves and Surfaces including Geodesics and Gauss-Bonnet Theorem-using the elementary differential geometry of curves (one-dimensional manifolds) and surfaces (two-dimensional manifolds) as a motivation.      Differential Geometry is developed in this course using curves and surfaces as examples- this permits  easy visualization and also easy understanding by students of varying degrees of preparation. The generalizations of these ideas to higher-dimensional spaces is also discussed.      Applications of Differential Geometry to Bezier Curves and Surfaces in Computer Graphics, Configuration spaces of linkages in Mechanics and Curvature and Energy of a Bending Beam in Elasticity, Free Energy of a Polymer Chain, Free Energy of a Fluid Membranes, Metrics, Curvature and Geodesics in General Relativity are discussed in the course and in the course projects.
           The course is one of the electives for Mathematics Minor students. It might also be of interest to students of Computer Science (especially those interested in Computer Graphics or Robotics), Engineering (especially those interested in Mechanics, Robotics, Elasticity etc) and Physics (especially those interested in Condensed Matter Physics or Relativity). Graduate students of Physics and Engineering who would like a careful introduction to Differential Geometry might be interested in this course as well.

										<td><br><span>SPS301 History of the ‘Social’ is a core course for SPS Major, and can also be counted towards a minor in SPS. Although the course is located within SPS, it will also be of interest to students in PHL, and other majors, as it broadly deals with the making and applicability of concepts.       The course invites students from different disciplines to engage with the project of turning the ‘social’ into an object of inquiry. Building on the sense that though freely used in everyday life the word ‘social’ is little understood, the course will enable students to ask what makes a phenomena, a process, an event or a form of knowledge ‘social’. They will be able to ask and address questions such as, Do only human beings have society? How does one theorise something that is seemingly so near to us? And, why to theorise it in the first place? What is theory? Etc.       The course will open up these possibilities by introducing students to the various ways in which the ‘social’ has been broached and understood, particularly in the domain of inquiry we refer to as social theory. Students will learn to evaluate and apply theoretical perspectives to the world around them, and to appreciate both the possibilities and limitations of theorising as a way of understanding. The course has been designed in a way that students get a sense of the ‘social’ as a problem and not just as an abstract concept. They will get to see how various forms of social explanation developed in response to specific problems, and hence, how to assess them accordingly. The tensions and possibilities residing in each approach to the ‘social’ will be laid bare, enabling students to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each. They will be able to critically assess which of these approaches suits their own research interests best, and to use it productively and with awareness.       It is a reading intensive course and students will be expected to consistently work on challenging texts by major social theorists, anthropologists and historians. A typical class meeting will consist of lecturing, reading together as a class and discussion.   </span><br><br>

It can be chosen by all students, who are able to complete the prerequisites. Positive Psychology is the scientific enquiry of aspects of human experience which create and cultivate  joy and well-being. This growing and much delayed field of psychology exerts a very strong influence on several applied fields of psychology, which traditionally have been focused on what is ‘wrong’ with human experience. The present course will introduce the theory and practice of positive psychology which includes philosophical foundations of positive psychology, understandings of positive strengths and virtues, well-being through life span and applications. Alongside learning the theoretical concepts, the students will also have the opportunity to work through one’s own strengths through group projects. The course is designed with an applied orientation in intersections with health, clinical, counselling and sports psychology.  																																					 														            </span><br><br>

Students have been introduced to the intricacies of Sanskrit morphology and syntax in SAN101 and SAN102, and students began to read original, albeit relatively simpler, texts in SAN201. This course SAN202 concludes two years of Sanskrit study at the University, and thereby aims to bring students to a level where they will be self-sufficient in being able to continue their journey in the vast world of classical Sanskrit poetry and prose.
																																					
														        In this course, students will read some important sections from any distinguished literary works. This will be decided by the instructor, and could be a literary text such as Kālidāsa’s Raghuvaṃśa and Bhartṛhari’s Nītiśataka or a philosophical work like Śaṅkarācārya's commentary on the Īśopaniṣad. (The Raghuvaṃśa is traditionally identified as one of the five mahākāvyas of Sanskrit literature and narrates the stories of kings belonging to the Raghu dynasty. The Nītiśataka is one of the three śatakas (centuries of verses) composed by the scholar-king Bharṭrhari, dealing primarily with ethics and morality. The Iśopaniṣad is considered as among the earliest Upaniṣads and Śaṅkarācārya's commentary is extremely influential for the philosophical school of Advaita Vedānta.)In their previous study, students have been introduced to the importance of Sanskrit commentaries and they will refer to requisite commentaries in this course. Students will also be introduced to the styles, meters and peculiar syntactical forms found in such Sanskrit literary texts. This course seeks also to reinforce another important aim – to contrast some English translations of these influential works with the original Sanskrit text, thereby demonstrating to students the inevitable gap in any work of translation (and the consequent intellectual joy in being able to read the original!).</span><br><br>

																Bayesian Data Analysis will introduce students to Bayesian Inference principles while discussing several case studies. It is an alternative approach to data analysis, sometimes more practical and interpretable than its counterpart, the classical statistical inference.
																																					
														        This course will discuss concepts such as inference via simulation, some single-parameter models in the context of estimating cancer rates using informative prior distributions.
The real strength of Bayesian inference comes out in multi-parameter hierarchical models. This is discussed in the context of a meta-analysis in medicine - how we can combine information about the effectiveness of a drug from multiple studies.
This course also deals with the practical aspects of simulating posterior distributions using efficient jumping rules. Illustrative code examples are discussed using the R programming language.
This course is useful for all data-driven sciences. Bayesian inference provides a more practical approach to inference than the classical. The course is targeted at students majoring in Computer Science, Physics, Economics, and Biological Life Sciences.

																Theatre has evolved through time as an important tool of expression and communication.  It is not only a source of entertainment but can serve as a catalyst for social reform or development. Theatre also expands our connection to the larger world around us, and our empathy for lives lived differently from our own. A director or an actor thinks from the perspective of the diverse characters they portray, improving tolerance towards others in the society. The audience, in turn, becomes witness to worlds that they might otherwise not encounter or be familiar with. Studies have also shown that students who participate in theatre perform better in academics as it enhances their power to express themselves.This course aims to introduce students to the different forms and functions of theatre, inclusive of the wide range of roles theatre practitioners can take on, such as directing, acting and scriptwriting.  We will also simultaneously discuss how theatre relates to societal concerns, using theatre games to help students to find present day issues that are relevant to them. Importantly, we will work together on producing skits and script writing in peer groups to encourage students to work cohesively in groups, overcome their inhibitions and find the confidence to engage in creative self-expression.This course is at beginner level & doesn’t require prior theatre experience. It is open to all students at the University. It will run for  one session a week (for 3 hours) as in a lab course. It is offered by Kabir Thakore, the Director of the Scrapyard Theatre in Ahmedabad.

Hopefully many of us also agree that going ahead, the lens through which we see our planet must not be human-centric. Instead of pollution and selfishness can we dream of forests, birds, sounds and colours? Can we rectify historical inequalities and accept that we humans are not at the centre of all “need” cycles? Can we dream of a world where nature has been returned to nature? This field of thought (that questions what happens when you remove the human from the centre of all design and enquiry) is often termed posthumanism. And today artists are at the forefront of this kind of imagining. In this course, we will look at how contemporary art delves into posthumanism through a series of ‘thought experiments’ that question our understanding of subjects such as the divide between nature and humanity, of what being human really means, and what it means to create art that transcends humanism and embraces technology (think A.I.) and nature. Practically, each ‘experiment’ will last for one module. In each we will question a received idea and think about ways of seeing it using a diverse range of techniques and materials (selected by students according to their preference). Making art is a component of each module but the emphasis is more on conceptual work. For each thought experiment, we will not only create art but watch films and go outside the classroom to visit local artists engaging the above themes in their studios. We will discuss, see, create and think, and maybe, as a result, learn to see the world around us very differently. This is a 100 level course with 3 credits, and open to all the students in the University.																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

To understand the literature of Premchand is to understand the history of the hopes, aspirations, and social consciousness of the Hindi-Urdu speaking society. In this course, an attempt will be made to read Premchand's literature in two layers. The first layer of reading will bring together Premchand's historical context, the period of the Indian national movement, and Gandhi's Hindustani movement. The second layer of readings will connect present-day issues like nationalism, communalism, caste, gender, and class, to Premchand's articulation of those questions. Premchand is equally a representative writer of both Hindi and Urdu languages. Getting acquainted with his literature in light of the Hindi-Urdu composite culture will give students a new perspective on understanding contemporary issues and their historical underpinnings.</span><br><br>

What is the relationship between social structures, normative orders and political outcomes as understood in the social sciences? How have the big transformations in information technology and capitalism in the 21st century fundamentally impacted the political economy, individual subjectivity, production, labour and consumption. Drawing on a social science framework for understanding the relations among individual, social and economic action, the course introduces students to the socially embedded nature of economic arrangements and political economy.

2. Forms of Exchange;
3. Systems of production, consumption and circulation;

										<td><br><span>“Believing is seeing” is the Apple catchphrase to introduce its Pro Display XDR on the website. Only when one scrolls down can they know the technical details and the design that are ultimately there to promise a high-end visual experience. Apple is only one of many examples where visual experiences occupy a central position in understanding the contemporary and how that informs one’s relationship with history and the past. These instances demonstrate that visual experiences are powerful mediators in a modern world where the clinical faculty of human vision assumes one of the central sensory responses. Indeed, seeing shapes what one believes about the world around and the ideologies structuring belief systems.  

Through intensive hands-on analyses of selected themes and specific visual forms, this course will look into how visual arts shape modern South Asian experiences and craft one’s understanding of their contemporary and their past. It will discuss how visual art forms encode social norms and practices and embody myriad ways of seeing. The pedagogy and class discussions will revolve around the following key issues: What are the objects and sites through which unfolding stories of visual forms may be tracked? Why are artistic practices integral to addressing imperial, colonial, and postcolonial experiences? How do art forms forge community identities in the region, and what are their political implications? Do visual arts practices in modern South Asia belong to a fixed geographical and cultural landscape? Or does thinking about them entail thinking about shifting geopolitical and cultural boundaries? 

These concerns will be addressed by closely experiencing specific media and material objects and their layered narratives. Students will have the opportunity of studying images and objects closely in museum and gallery spaces and appreciate their material, texture, colour and scale, which are often lost in digital projections in the classroom. Simultaneously, the course will weave together abstract thinking with historically and anthropologically grounded scholarship to train students not to see visual arts as naïve forms; students will learn to analyse formal structures and social histories and how visual imageries structure one’s historical consciousness.

										<td><br><span>This course is designed for beginners and those who have minimal painting experience. Students will learn the fundamentals of the painting process while exploring different mediums including acrylic, water colour, and oil, and also paper, canvas, and panels as support. Though this course is intended as an introduction to the methods, materials, and techniques associated with painting, discussions of art history will establish a context for understanding the discipline of painting more fully.
																					
														        																					
														        																					
														        																					
														        This course is also an introduction to objective observation of the world as we see it - not as we think we see it and rendering that view in artwork. Beginning with basic principles of painting, this course will continue to challenge and build students’ skill as a painter through representational, abstract, and non-representational style of painting. Among other traditional subject matters including still life, landscapes and cityscapes, our exploration may even include renderings of machines and biological specimens. Studio sessions will be majorly spent making paintings, which will touch upon concepts crucial to the creative process, including critical thinking, discipline, and spontaneity.
Students will complete this course with a basic but strong understanding of making paintings, and also develop competency, both visual and technical, involved in painting. The goal of this course is to give students the basic tools and ideas necessary to begin their own personal painting practice along with finding a means for self-expression through the medium of painting.</span><br><br>

In this introductory course, we will explore a set of influential contemporary moral theories, and learn how these can be applied to some of the most pressing moral issues of our time. We will address some aspects of the following questions. Is there a criterion for distinguishing between right and wrong? Are morals culturally relative? What is the best human life? What might be the moral bases for accepting or rejecting practices like euthanasia, abortion, affirmative action, and civil disobedience? To what extent are we obligated to assist people in need? How ought we to treat animals? What might an ethical relationship between nations look like? Finally, we will discuss a subset of key ethical issues relating to the fields of engineering, business, neuroscience and psychology, and the natural and social sciences.</span><br><br>

However, early in the 21st century, China and India are nation-states that are once again being seen as two emerging powers of the global economy. The rise of India and China has fundamentally altered the modern world, whether that be politically, economically, culturally, or sociologically. Both nations, with their gigantic populations and extensive resources, now command yet again a level of worldwide influence not seen since the mid-18th century. Although they share many similarities, there are also many differences in these two Asian countries’ development paths. This course aims to compare and contrast the two nations along several different axes. Each is discussed from both Chinese and Indian perspectives to deepen students’ understanding of various issues in the two societies</span><br><br>

The course has two purposes: One, it aims to acquaint students with selected forms and practices in the Indian subcontinent, especially those identified as heritage (e.g. classical and folk performing arts, crafts, material culture, etc.) and as modern and contemporary art (e.g. painting, installation art, etc.). Two, it encourages students to look critically at the categories of art, culture and heritage, and examine how they intersect with national/regional/global politics, cultural institutions, livelihoods, markets, legal regimes, etc. In addition, this course will offer students a hands-on opportunity to develop skills centered on communication about art, culture and heritage.</span><br><br>

It is a complex set of variables, causalities, decisions, relationships, and improbable coincidences.The Sweep of History aims to introduce students to at least 13.8 billion years of history and think about the future through the course of 25 moments in time and space, beginning with the Big Bang and ending with a contemplation of the death of the world as we know it. The overarching theme may seem to be inevitable human progress and an increasingly globalized world, but we’ll see that this is only one narrative among many others. Likewise, the only actors in this drama may seem to be humans, but we’ll also try to think about the role of Nature in history.The Sweep of History is not intended to be a comprehensive history of everything. Rather think of this as a process of discovery as we explore various themes. But this also as an introduction into history as a discipline. You will explore the methods of the historian: how does the historian grapple with their position in time and in the world? How does the historian reconstruct the past? How does the historian narrate the past (and think about the present and the future)? The assignments and final project will allow you to experience first hand what it means to do history.</span><br><br>

Khayal is about presenting ragas with compositions set in talas and includes considerable improvisation. This practice course will impart training in Khayal at a basic level. Five ragas will be taught of which three will be in more detail. Each raga will be introduced through the skeletal scalar structure to more complex levels of their melodic movements, phrases, and ornament. Compositions and elements of improvisation such as aalaap and taan will be taught. The compositions will be chosen to cover four important talas. The course will also include guided listening sessions of masters rendering these ragas, a theoretical understanding of concepts used in performance, and a brief history of Khayal.

										<td><br><span>Scholarship on the topic of citizenship unfailingly reminds us that ‘citizenship is a contested concept’ or a ‘terrain of struggle’. While many of these contestations are peculiar to their contexts, one debate that has invariably shaped our understanding of citizenship is that between citizenship as a universal principle and that of group-differentiated citizenship. The principle of universal citizenship suggests that the benefits of being a citizen have been becoming progressively universal and equal. The group-differentiated understanding of citizenship, however, exhorts that a theory of citizenship that is blind to differences only deepens the marginalization that disadvantaged groups experience in society. This course will use this debate as a jumping board to dive into the Indian story of gendering citizenship. The use of ‘gender’ is often critiqued for its singular focus on ‘women’. This course will not necessarily be troubling that but will rather address the impossibility of a unitary category of woman. Drawing on critical intersectional feminist scholarship, this course hopes to provide a richly textured story of gendered citizenship in India.Women’s movements and feminist movements in India have played a vital role in transforming gender based discrimination from an object of social reform to a subject of Rights. That said, these movements have been called out for their bias towards middle and upper class/caste women. Through an intersectional approach this course aims to highlight the challenges posed by marginalized groups about their exclusions both from Indian women’s and feminist movements as well as from citizenship, while being attentive to the importance of feminist solidarity and coalition building across differences for inclusive citizenship. 

This course is organized around 3 Modules Politics of Representation, Assertion of Rights, and Forging Feminist Solidarity. Readings have been selected to reflect the heterogeneity that marks the category of ‘woman’ but also to highlight how gendered identities are constituted through claims for citizenship, in turn, shaping our understanding of state and community.  The Module on Representation is focussed on gendered struggles around inclusion in formal politics, a normatively male domain. While claims for political representation is in itself an assertion of rights, the course treats representation as a separate category because political representation often enables a more confident articulation of other rights. The module on Rights sheds light on the material realities of citizenship, its attendant exclusions, and the claims for rights-both in law and in practice- that these exclusions give rise to. Both group differentiated citizenship and an intersectional analysis troubles a number of citizenship scholars for their fragmenting effects. The module on Solidarity will focus on feminist movements that strive to build coalitions across differences for securing women’s rights of equal citizenship. The course underscores that despite its gendered exclusions the promises of inclusive and universalist claims of citizenship makes engendering citizenship an important analytical and political tool for addressing wrongs.

But it is not that straight forward as, if the DNA in all cells are the same then how a liver cell decides to make a liver and not the skin. There should be some factors determining the number of genes to turn on and off depending on whether it’s a liver cell or the skin cell. Few sets of genes are turned on and off in making a liver cell a liver cell and a skin cell a skin cell and this is known as epigenome. Epigenetics is a set of hereditable changes in gene expression that takes place in the cells without changing the DNA sequence.This course deals with the epigenetics and the role of various epigenetic modifications   in the development and diseases. 																																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

First part involves laying theoretical foundation and second one is about applying these techniques in practice. Module on Creativity explains how systematically one can come up with several innovative and novel solutions to given problem under specified requirements. InJobs-to-be-done, students will learn to understand customer requirements and identify right kind of problem. Design thinking sets up a systematic approach from idea generation to prototype building.In the second part of practically applying concepts, student will learn to make things such as design, CAD, drawings and prototype. This session involves more activities on student side with the guidance from faculty. This involves talking to the customers, understanding market requirements, understanding availability of the technology and infrastructure, actually coming up with feasible ideas andimplementing them by designing and making a working model.</span><br><br>

This helps to analyze and understand the world around us. It allows visual perception in the Artificial Intelligence agent. CV occupies a significant importance in the fields of healthcare, mobility, security, entertainment, and robotics. The major thrust of the course will be to develop models and to put them in practice through algorithms on images and videos. This will translate ideas from theory to practice.The course is meant to cover recent advances in the domain of computer vision.  The course will gradually meander from low level computer vision to high level concepts. It will introduce tradition CV topics like filters, local image features and texture descriptors, then move to mid-level vision covering visual matching through Hough transform, optical flow. It ends up in high-level vision tasks like segmentation, tracking, classification, detecting objects and person recognition. 																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

With cross-organization workflows and complex compliance requirements, industry sectors like Healthcare, Finance, Manufacturing, International Trade, Insurance, Retail, Supply Chain, Recruitment, Media, Real-estate, and Education etc. can benefit significantly by improved operational efficiency, enhanced security, and transparency offered by blockchain implementation.    However, Blockchain technology practices and research activities are currently in initial phase and evolving continuously with new tools, technologies, approaches and application strategies. In such scenario, it is difficult for students, researchers or practitioners to get right entry into the subject. This course will be instrumental in developing familiarity with theoretical concepts, underlying technology, tools, implementation strategies and current practices.  The course will offer detailed overview of two major technology stacks, along with detailed technical discussion on application and research areas.																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

										<td><br><span> 																 																 																 																 																 																 																 																 																 																It may be argued that democracy has emerged as the most desirable, if not the most successful, form of government in the contemporary world. Regardless of whether we like a particular democracy or not, arguments about what is the most legitimate and just form of rule point towards democracy. Why is democracy seen as the most just form of rule? How did such a situation come about historically? Is there evidence to show that, all things considered, democracies are indeed the most just form of government known to us?  Are there specific civic virtues that help democracies flourish? Is there a particular way in which agreement, dissent, cooperation, and conversation between different groups and individuals in a democratic society is to be carried out? Would democracy be a necessary component of a just system of government? And would social justice be a necessary component of democratic government?  These are some of the questions that this course will tackle. The entire course is built on two central ideas about democracy: a) how best to safeguard against arbitrary exercise of state power, and b) how best cultivate the virtue of democratic conversation. The course is divided into four taught modules and a fifth project module. Each of the four modules are built around a normative statement, which is supposed to provoke and organise the discussions within that module. The four normative statements are: Module 1: "Democracy is the most just form of government" Module 2: "Rights take precedence over popular will" Module 3:  "Inequality is antithetical to democracy” 																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

										<td><br><span> 																 																 																 																 																 																 																 																 																 																 																 																 																 																Since time immemorial, human activities have significantly impacted the nature of our planet. Issues such as depleting resources, climate extremes, land degradation, food insecurity, unsustainable consumption and unequal access to resources, pollution, ecosystem degradation and extinction of species have posed challenges of sustainability that span spatial and temporal scales. However, in the recent past, efforts related to conservation and sustainability have also increased manifold, paving the way for a slightly hopeful future. On the crossroads of these vectors, multiple questions such as: what are the sustainability challenges facing humanity? How do we measure environmental footprints? How do we assess uncertainties and risks? Who bears the burden of costs and risks? Can we make our consumption behavior sustainable? How do we create, replicate and upscale innovative ideas? How do we evolve a just governance system to share costs and benefits equitably?, etc. need to be addressed and answered. The millennials must be equipped to comprehend and answer these questions in a meaningful and an engaging manner. This course, through an integration of diverse domains - materials, data science, biology and life, behaviour, communication, and constitution and civilization, will expose students to 1. appreciate and develop an integrated understanding of these issues and their interactions, 2. 																 																																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

The course will explore ways of understanding the neighborhood in geographic, historical, cultural, governance terms, as well as its biodiversity, lifestyle and health profile, economic and social characteristics, and physical attributes among other aspects. The course begins with defining and conceptualising neighbourhood. Students would visualize the neighborhood using different thematic maps, and the evolution of cultural and social characteristics of the neighborhoods would be investigated. Analysis of demographic features, livelihood profiles, governance structures, and flow of services would enable students to appreciate modern neighbourhoods. Biodiversity would be explored to evaluate the biological richness of the neighbourhood. Health status and lifestyle of the individual in the neighborhood would be surveyed. Students would also get an opportunity to explore the physical nature of the neighbourhood. 																																					 														        The course will anchor hands-on learning activities in the contexts of a few local neighbourhoods. Students, working in groups, will observe and engage in surveying and document data on the above themes. Besides, students will get a broader perspective on demographic, economic and social characteristics from the population census data and health status from the CMIE economic outlook data. Students will then engage in analyzing the data to understand the neighbourhood. The learning from this course would facilitate students to build a vision around the interplay of the environment, behaviour, and development associated with the neighbourhoods.</span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>The two extreme points from where we look at water could be "Water is life, and clean water means health" - Audrey Hepburn, or an extremely scary angle e.g., "World War III will be fought over water"– Special Broadcasting Service (Aug 17, 2017). Both highlight the urgency for us to act - as citizens and as scientists. However, how much do we think of water? How much do we know of this resource apart from what we have read in our school textbooks? Is the water crisis real? Are we taking the right decisions today to secure a better future for the coming generations? How can I, as an individual and as a community participate in the process? Also, as the driver for all forms of life on earth, water is an excellent solvent, however, this excellent solvent’s characteristic, when combined with its flow, makes it a potent carrier of pollutants and pathogenic microorganisms that are often harmful to health. So, what makes water safe to consume and use for many other purposes? Is the water in surface and groundwater bodies in the Ahmedabad area safe for all forms of life? Is it potable? This course will turn students into aware citizens of the country by enabling them to ask relevant questions around the subject of water. 																 																 																 																																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>
