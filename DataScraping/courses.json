The Competition Commission\u2019s intervention or NCLT\u2019s ruling make further additions to the M&A news. M&As are the causes and results of corporate restructuring necessitated by both ups and downs of the national economy. The managements of the merging companies defend their M&A decisions. The employees become uneasy and skeptical about their future. The stock market reacts positively or negatively. While the overt motives behind many mergers are \u2018growth\u2019 through organic or inorganic combinations, the covert purposes can be driven by \u2018managerial hubris\u2019. But the fact remains; most M&As are failing sooner or later as the mysterious M&A chemistry is less understood. The failure rates are more in developing economies, even though successful CEOs strike the deals. Experts are unanimous in expressing that majority of failed mergers are the results of unscientific M&A decisions but it remains an exotic bets; win some lose some.",

Projects are vital and often businesses and various functions start with this management operation. Initial activities within a function also start with projects, for eg.

This is designed specifically for the Heritage Management students, and is to be offered in the final semester of the programme. The idea behind this course is not to \u2018teach\u2019 a particular way of professional practice and or a set of ethics, but to make students aware of multiple fields of practice in different settings, and to sensitize them on potential roles, responsibilities, rights as well as ethical concerns that may come in such fields of practices \u2013 particularly keeping in mind their own scenarios or career plans as they graduate from the Masters degree in Heritage Management.Heritage is a broad concept connecting to various disciplines and almost all levels of society. Heritage Management is an evolving field of practice which aims to keep the heritage idea in focus while working in development, planning, economic activities, community development, research and institution building etc. Hence, there are multiple avenues of practice that the graduates of the Heritage management programme may pursue \u2013 from being an individual heritage professional to taking a leading position in a heritage related organization, from setting up their own entrepreneurial business to venturing into a large scale corporate type set up tapping into any sector of heritage, i.e. textile or metal work etc., from joining a government department to working in the NGO sector, from being an administrator in a local urban body to being an academician, and so on. Accordingly, it comes with its own complexities and potential conflicts of interests too. It is in such contexts that this course aims to highlight the potential overlaps, conflict of interests, individual and societal rights, organizational behavior and ethics etc. that may be relevant to heritage practitioners. This is not an exclusive course to cover all possible topics and areas \u2013 which perhaps is impossible, but this is a course to trigger such sensitivities in the minds of future heritage managers, and to enable them to explore such issues and be prepared to frame their career plan and professional activities in a more just and responsible ways.",

It is also important for individuals who create any original work, be it in the scientific, literary, or cultural domain. Intellectual property rights are considered monopolistic rights, but the monopoly is a limited one as the IPRs will go in the public domain after a certain stipulated time. The ethical implications of the IPRs will be discussed and deliberated during the course through various case studies where monopolistic presence versus the social benefits are in conflict especially pharmaceutical products and/or utilitarian goods. The course will familiarize students with the popular types of intellectual properties and the legal provisions related to them and the administrative remedies which can be sought for. With the advent of technology, intellectual property protection has become a challenge due to piracy. The course deals with the technological solutions to the sustainable inventions and whether they can be protected through IPRs or not he course also looks into the contemporary issues of Intellectual Property rights in the global context.

Answers to these questions are not simple, and there scarcely exists a unique solution for any one of them. Nevertheless, principles of economics, both micro and macro, often provide an interesting and effective framework on which the logic of international economic issues can be constructed.\u00a0 \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t         EPP530 International Economics provides an insight into some of these principles and equips graduate students with the understanding of the functioning of the economies in a globalized world.

How have the Indian values and socio-cultural perspectives been informed by the stories and anecdotes from the two great Sanskrit epics?

And, more importantly, how can cultural organisations identify, understand and respond to the ongoing change? The course aims at providing the theoretical models and practical tools that would enable cultural organisations to manage change, benefiting from some of the latest developments in the areas of business management, strategy and marketing.  In this context, the key challenges for cultural organisations are to: \u2022 be agile in the changing and fluid environment;  \u2022 achieve and sustain innovation over time; and  \u2022 maintain and increase their visitors and networks, securing financial viability and also contributing to the development of the local and the broader community.  A wide range of cultural organisations, international and Asian and Indian ones, from both the public and the private sector are used as case studies. The ultimate aim of the course is to contribute to the shaping of the heritage managers of tomorrow.",

Theories and models in urban planning and design would be covered followed by a discussion on alternative urban development approaches and formulation of urban and transport infrastructure policy, and a liberal planning framework.  The objective of Module-2: Urban transport is to introduce urban transport infrastructure planning, design, and management.  Public transport, which is instrumental in a city\u2019s socioeconomic development, will be a key focus.  Various debates and topical issues surrounding urban planning and transport will be covered by critical review assignments.",

Against the backdrop of Neoclassical economics (specifically Expected Utility Theory), this course will discuss deviations from the standard concepts of individual preferences, beliefs, and decision-making processes. In doing so, we will see that people are loss-averse, present-biased, more social, and often use heuristics in their decision-making. Experimental evidence from education, labour, health, public economics/finance and development economics will elucidate these ideas.  More broadly, this course will provide students with an overview of how researchers and policymakers have leveraged their understanding of behavioural and experimental economics to study and find solutions to fix undesirable or less desirable individual decisions (from a social planner\u2019s perspective). Considering that this is an introductory course, the theory and experiments will be discussed with a greater focus on intuition and a lesser emphasis on the technicalities. The mathematical technicalities, along with the fine details behind the design of an experiment, could be worked upon in a more advanced level course on experimental and/or behavioural economics.",

Above all, the course encourages current and potential heritage managers to adopt a new \u2018paradigm\u2019 that would recognize the local communities as the long-term custodians of their heritage and themselves as the supporters and mediators \u2013 towards the continual creation of heritage in the present and the future. \nThe course addresses undergraduate and postgraduate students interested in heritage sites (religious sites, historical towns and villages) and local communities, and in tourism.",

It is not what you think and says but what they (the audience) perceive and believe. Therefore, branding is a function of strategy and psychology that embeds various facets of design in it.This course is designed to cover the fundamentals of branding and packaging to sensitize you to the decision-making process required to create a cohesive brand language.

Although India is a small market for luxury goods currently (projected value of $8.5 billion in 2023), according to this report, it could reach up to $200 billion by 2030. Apple opened two stores in India this year, Louis Vuitton roped in Deepika Padukone as its first-ever Indian house ambassador, Gucci appointed Alia Bhatt as its first global ambassador from India, and Dior held its first-ever fashion show in India. These and other developments show that the Indian luxury market is ready to take off. This has been possible because of a large number of young, educated, and economically well-off Indian consumers who are exposed to global luxury brands and want to enjoy and showcase their success by buying luxury goods.\n\nIn this course, Marketing Luxury Brands, the students will learn to analyze and understand the marketing mix applied to managing luxury brands. Students will learn about the sociological and psychological factors that shape the behavior of luxury consumers. They will learn what makes a product a luxury brand, where these brands are sold, and how the messaging is different for luxury brands. This course also has a set of case studies that will help the students learn to analyze real-world marketing scenarios involving luxury brands.",

During  the past few years the concept of Global Commons has extended  from  Climate and Biodiversity to  include global peace, zoonotic global pandemics like  COVID 19 , Arts and Heritage and  the global financial order. A classic case of the importance of global peace as a Global Commons is that of the volatile situation created by North Korea and the Russian invasion of Ukraine  which has had ramifications across the world by way of biodiversity loss , climate change ,global recession, oil price hikes. The  importance of multilateral and bilateral negotiations to resolve these issues  has been crucial. Meanwhile international financing agencies such as the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, the European Investment Bank and the Global Environmental Facility have developed  portfolios on climate change and biodiversity by way of direct investments and transfer of new patented technologies in low carbon technologies. The other significant development has been the advent  of digital ledgers like Block chains and AI and the metaverse which have found applications in the management of these global commons.",

The students are introduced to municipal corporation and municipality laws, urban planning laws, solid waste management rules, street vendors\u2019 legislation, and financial instruments available for urban management. Finally, students will be introduced to the impacts of climate change on heritage areas.\n\nThe students will work through the course at three levels. The first level is they will be introduced to theoretical debates on urban governance in India. The second level is they will read the relevant legislation for different states in India to be introduced to the federal nature of urban planning and governance in India. The third level is taking the example of a heritage neighbourhood in Ahmedabad will analyse various aspects of urban governance and propose solutions to the governance challenges using relevant legislation. At the city level, the students will also map the current institutional structures of heritage management. The neighbourhood selection should include residential neighborhoods along with heritage precincts of Grade I or II. The final output will be a Heritage Management Plan for the selected neighbourhood.",

The intent is to get the perspective of the investor in this space and learn how these investment firms are structured and what their business models are. They will learn the basics of due diligence, valuation and deal structuring. The students will learn about team building, effective communication and negotiation with internal and external stakeholders through case study assignments. They will learn how to make a pitch on behalf of a startup as well as how to evaluate a pitch on behalf of the investors by participating in classroom case study exercises. \nIndia is witnessing a boom in investments by venture capital and private equity firms post COVID in terms of doubling of investment teams by top funds in 2019-2023 period (Bain & Company\u2019s Global Private Equity Report, 2024). The first half of 2024 has shown a clear trend towards hiring in key areas that support technology, operational efficiency, ESG initiatives, healthcare innovation and financial strategy, as per a study by Prequin (Prequin Private Capital Compensation and Employment Review 2024 by Ferguson Partners) shows that 54% of private equity firms plan to increase the hiring of finance professionals in 2024 to support their growth and expansion strategies. It is desirable for the MBA and MSQF students to have an exposure to the Private Equity industry.\nIn the Indian context, in the recent years the relevance of small and medium enterprises for development has become particularly noteworthy. As these firms are more constrained than large firms in terms of access to financial capital, venture capital and private equity play a vital role in constituting a valuable resource for a firm\u2019s growth, especially for the more innovative SMEs, so that they can support economic development and innovation in the economy. Private Equity is considered an important element of a good entrepreneurial eco-system and a critical source of finance for start-ups, growing companies and for takeover transactions",

It aims to build upon the important accounting concepts and principles including revenue recognition, inventory, depreciation, and understanding the accounting equation. The course focuses initially on how to record economic events in the accounting records (i.e., bookkeeping and accrual accounting) and how to prepare and interpret the primary financial statements that summarize a firm's economic transactions (i.e., the balance sheet, the income statement, and the statement of cash flows). The course adopts a decision-maker perspective of accounting by emphasizing the relation between accounting data and the underlying economic events that generated them thereby enabling the students to read, understand and analyse financial statements through ratio analysis. The course also explores the areas of financial shenanigans wherein the students will be able to learn how companies use financial statements to disguise economic reality.",

Through a series of illustrations from media, art, rituals on one hand and ordinary situations when the \u2018cultural\u2019 asserts itself both overtly and covertly, on the other hand, the course hopes to make students aware of every situation that has a cultural dimension even when we least expect it to be.",

In this sense, organisations are not merely seen as a place where communication happens, but it exists because employees communicate and create the sense in the existing structure. Also, the idea of the workplace has moved beyond the simple \"office space\" to \"living social networks\" that combine work, home and play. Moreover, organisations use their website and social media to communicate with internal and external stakeholders. Viewed, thus, in this context, the course looks at the constitutive view of communication and intends to familiarise students with workplace communications as practised in the corporate world. The course is interdisciplinary and involves the combination of concepts (communication, sociology and computer-mediated technology) into one project.",

In doing so, students are introduced to the various types of derivative instruments available in the marketplace, their applications, and the associated market structures and price mechanisms that govern these instruments. Furthermore, students are introduced to relevant risk management strategies that market participants can implement at various levels of the value chain to mitigate different risks.India now ranks among the global leaders in derivatives trading activity. Consequently, this course is also designed to make students appreciate the opportunities and challenges with respect to Indian & Global derivative markets, without losing sight of the regulatory actions that have enabled the prevalence of the derivatives market in the first place.  This course enables students to master the analytical tools (valuation, hedging, and pricing) of derivatives, with a strong emphasis on quantitative techniques and practical applications in global and Indian markets.",

        "description": "In the contemporary age of increasing integration among the economies of the world, questions such as why and how countries trade with one another, how international capital flows are decided, how do indigenous firms compete against the mighty multinational corporations, the relevance of interest and inflation rate differentials, how the international value of currency gets decided, and many more, call for the attention of students of Economics. Answers to these questions are not simple, and there scarcely exists a unique solution for any one of them. Nevertheless, principles of Economics, both Micro and Macro, often provide an interesting and effective framework on which the logic of international economic issues can be constructed.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t         International Economics provides an insight into some of these principles and equips undergraduate students in the field of management with the understanding of the functioning of the economies in a globalized world. The course covers essential theories of International Economics as well as empirical analysis of some of the most important global events that have altered the way in which economies have functioned over the last few decades.",

Conventionally the three themes; energy, environment and sustainability; are perceived through the lens of trade-offs. This perspective is changing in recent times. Policymakers, professionals and civil society actors are cooperating to align strategies and actions across themes to overcome societal and individual risks and to gain co-benefits and comparative advantage. In many environmentally proactive entities, \u201csustainability\u201d is a core issue that is increasingly integrated with organizational processes, systems and strategies. Delineation of policies to align energy, environment and sustainability is a highly explored subject drawing interest from researchers and practitioners. The course is divided into four modules which combine distinct yet inter-related concepts around the three central themes. The sessions cover the landscape ranging from global, national to local, spanning technologies, management and concepts from social sciences and ecology.\u00a0Objectives\u2022\tIntroduce the energy, environment and sustainability themes and their nexus;\u00a0\u2022\tExplore the contemporary perspectives and approaches to sustainability;\u2022\tAssess practical frameworks for aligning the policies and actions to maximize welfare of present and future generations;\u2022\tDelineate the mix of policy and technology innovations to harmonize the environment, energy and sustainability nexus into the future.",

Consumers often make irrational choices. Decisions are based on emotions and unconscious motivations \u2013 not only on rational logic. Consumer choices are implicit not explicit. Consumers cannot often express their motivations in response to traditional marketing research surveys. This is because consumers either won\u2019t say why they made some choices (as the answers might not sound logical and reasonable) or they can\u2019t say (as choices were made at an unconscious level and they themselves do not know why they choose a brand). The course will draw on the works of several neuroscientists and behavioural economists like Daniel Kahneman, Richard Thaler, and Dan Ariely. We will use behavioural economics experiments (\u2018Nudge\u2019 as Richard Thaler calls it) to see how subtle interventions influence brand choices. We will explore how ethnography \u2013 a method of immersing oneself in consumer lives (used in anthropology and sociology) \u2013 can help us get under the skin of the consumer and observe the role of products and brands in consumer life, as lived and not as claimed in surveys.",

The intent is to give a foundation in design to students enrolled in any programme at the University by exposing them to the basic design fundamentals - principles, methods, processes and approaches. The course will expose the students to the user-centric approach that design adopts to address local and global challenges. They will learn to recognise that design is exploratory in nature and helps navigate ambiguity. It promotes new ways of looking at problems and coming up with solutions which are human-centered and inclusive.With practical exercises, the course will give an overview of the critical design thinking used for problem identification and opportunity mapping in any given context. Students will gain an understanding of design as a creative problem-solving tool to come up with holistic solutions for products, services, systems and experiences. The course is expected to rouse a student\u2019s interest in design. It will equip them with the necessary grounding to pursue design as a higher education or career pathway. Importantly, it will add a richer and diverse perspective to their understanding of their own field of Major education be it management, technology, sciences, humanities or social sciences.This course is open for students who are admitted to any programme at the University",

        "description": "Visual/Creative communication in the digital age requires familiarisation and literacy that goes way beyond \u2013 beyond traditional practices. Digital is no longer a grey area. It becomes inevitable that the brand language be effectively transformed from one media to another without changing the brand image. Throughout this course, the focus would be to expose students to ideas, applications, experiences and opportunities that are relevant to today\u2019s times. This course is primarily about creating visual artefacts that communicate effectively, but that does not mean you need to be an artist to succeed. Assessment will focus upon your efforts and your willingness to engage with your classmates to provide feedback and learn from one another. The more time you spend with the exercises in this course, the more skills you will develop as a visual communicator. Take the time to explore each exercise, take risks, and reiterate often. Don\u2019t allow your first attempt at any solution to be your only attempt. Fail early and fail often. Learning what doesn\u2019t work is an essential process in understanding what does work. This course is open for students who are admitted to any programme at the University.",

Operational excellence is critical for success in many service industries today, global competition and rapidly evolving information technology. However, understanding service operations is not easy. Services are intangible, highly variable, not storable or transportable and often involve distributed operations with a significant amount of customer contact. This means that most service operations look quite different than manufacturing operations, and they often require specialized analytical frameworks and tools which the present course aims to address.",
