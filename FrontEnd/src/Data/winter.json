An organization with a project culture is one that knows where it is going, is focused on results and has a professional team who knows what is expected of them. Professionals & organizations working or desiring to start a new venture in diverse fields require an understanding and insight of Project Management concepts and methods.

Launching a new product in the market or implementing ERP within the organisation. The products are developed at lab scale, tried at pilot scale and produced at plant scale. To handle all these activities later in their careers, management students have to learn Project Management techniques and through planning and control techniques to execute projects., View/Print Outline",

Design is a set of activities and processes to bring about this improvement and beneficial change on their own. Design Thinking is a set of activities and processes to let design happen on its own. It is aimed at making designerly behaviour a very core mindset and bodyset.Design Thinking in the modern context is recognised as a core business activity which is capable of enhancing all activities around it, making them better and more human and consequently profitable as well. Over the years, it has developed as a very robust and ever-evolving combination of design, science, human behaviour and business principles. At the centre of this is the target user for whom systems are built to understand them, empathise with them define their problems and help them solve these problems through strategically targeted design interventions. Ultimately, all business is about the people who invest in it through one or the other level of consumer behaviour. Design Thinking is aimed at giving business thinkers, a very deeply strategic advantage in the market.The proposed course is an introduction to Design Thinking which is delivered through a set of 14 sessions, discussions, and structured assignments that help internalise these basic concepts. Several minor assignments and a major project serve as a vehicle for participative action that is central to the understanding of Design Thinking as applied to imaginative business models while understanding four key aspects \u2013 context, intent, recipients of the design and the system involved., View/Print Outline",

It is also important for individuals who create any original work, be it in the scientific, literary, or cultural domain. Intellectual property rights are considered monopolistic rights, but the monopoly is a limited one as the IPRs will go in the public domain after a certain stipulated time. The ethical implications of the IPRs will be discussed and deliberated during the course through various case studies where monopolistic presence versus the social benefits are in conflict especially pharmaceutical products and/or utilitarian goods. The course will familiarize students with the popular types of intellectual properties and the legal provisions related to them and the administrative remedies which can be sought for. With the advent of technology, intellectual property protection has become a challenge due to piracy. The course deals with the technological solutions to the sustainable inventions and whether they can be protected through IPRs or not he course also looks into the contemporary issues of Intellectual Property rights in the global context. The course will also provide insight into the competitive and strategic advantages of enterprises by using Intellectual Property Rights ., View/Print Outline",

These businesses, which primarily operate for economic benefits of their owners, must also take into account the interests of other stakeholders. The course deals with ethical considerations and dilemmas that affect managerial decisions and equips the learners with methods to deal with such situations. The course is delivered in two parts; foundations of ethics and managerial dilemmas in operational areas. The first part introduces foundational concepts and theories of ethics that provide different perspectives to ethical concerns and dilemmas. The second half deals with specific ethical concerns arising in functional areas of management and ways to resolve these conflicts in managerial decision-making., View/Print Outline",

        "Description": "The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), inaugurated in a summer workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956, has seen many ups and downs. After two short-lived booms in the early eighties and the late nineties, AI has come into its own in the last decade, partly because data-driven machine learning has tackled a wider range of problems than earlier approaches based on search, logic, and (human) expert knowledge. After a brief introduction to other areas of AI \u2013 game-playing, symbolic reasoning, knowledge representation, and planning \u2013 our course will focus mostly on machine learning. Together, machine learning and traditional statistics constitute data science, with everyday uses such as e-mail spam filtering and handwriting recognition and business applications such as credit rating, bankruptcy prediction, customer churn modelling, and employee turnover analysis. Today\u2019s business graduates must learn about these applications of AI (particularly machine learning) to remain competitive in the field of management. AI also attracts significant investment in the financial markets. Hence, a good understanding of the field is critical to making smart investments in information technology., View/Print Outline",

The course is therefore divided into two modules. The objectives of Module-1: Urban planning is to develop an understanding of the various theories of urban planning and design, introduce basic concepts of how cities develop, and the various approaches to planning and managing cities. Theories and models in urban planning and design would be covered followed by a discussion on alternative urban development approaches and formulation of urban and transport infrastructure policy, and a liberal planning framework.  The objective of Module-2: Urban transport is to introduce urban transport infrastructure planning, design, and management.  Public transport, which is instrumental in a city\u2019s socioeconomic development, will be a key focus.  Various debates and topical issues surrounding urban planning and transport will be covered by critical review assignments., View/Print Outline",

        "Description": "Brands exist in the consumers\u2019 minds and yet entice them to act as if it were a relationship of the heart.Brands often look for top-of-mind recall, but branding is an emotional connection that the audience forms with the brand and its message thereby creating a loyal following. It is not what you think and says but what they (the audience) perceive and believe. Therefore, branding is a function of strategy and psychology that embeds various facets of design in it.This course is designed to cover the fundamentals of branding and packaging to sensitize you to the decision-making process required to create a cohesive brand language. In a world dominated by brands, it is important to understand the key differentiating factor and then build an experience around it. Strategic Packaging design directly contributes to building a brand image by functional or aesthetic elements or by reinforcement of brand image by giving out an experience. This course will offer the tools and techniques required to formulate the right strategy for success.The pedagogy consists of interactive sessions with a healthy mix of fundamental theory, case studies, on the spot, and group assignments for hands-on learning.Your key takeaway from this course will be the ability to make smart decisions for building a successful brand image and a long-term plan for a lasting brand impression., View/Print Outline",

There are many examples of good designs which have been inspired by nature. Biomimicry is studying elements from nature: form, colour, function, movement, life cycle, growth, etc. and using it as an inspiration for designing products, spaces, visuals for communication, systems, etc.Today in our modern world and our way of life, we are moving away from our natural connection with nature. It is all the more critical that we study its various inspects to learn and use it as an inspiration for good design. The whole area of Biomimicry, Bionics, etc, has developed a lot and there is a lot more awareness about this field in current times. Toys are also recognized today as playing an important role in learning, development, building cultural connect and socio-emotional bonds and as part of the entertainment sector. Toys are a part of unstructured play and a means to create playful experiences.  In this course, we will study nature with a new perspective and explore possibilities of using it to ideate and design toys or playful elements., View/Print Outline",

So, why do so many products and services fail to achieve this ideal? All products, whether digital or otherwise, must deliver a high-quality user experience or risk losing users to competitors.The focus of interaction design is on user-centred design based on the understanding of real users including their experiences, goals, needs, wants and tasks. The goal of interaction design is also to collect and analyse data to make informed interface design decisions which are critical to creating and delivering successful products, services and systems that fulfil the user/customer, technological and business needs., View/Print Outline",

        "Description": "Ethics, as an area of philosophical inquiry, deals with the question of how we ought to act in any given situation. In this introductory course, we will explore a set of influential contemporary moral theories, and learn how these can be applied to some of the most pressing moral issues of our time. We will address some aspects of the following questions. Is there a criterion for distinguishing between right and wrong? Are morals culturally relative? What is the best human life? What might be the moral bases for accepting or rejecting practices like euthanasia, abortion, affirmative action, and civil disobedience? To what extent are we obligated to assist people in need? How ought we to treat animals? What might an ethical relationship between nations look like? Finally, we will discuss a subset of key ethical issues relating to the fields of engineering, business, and bioethics., View/Print Outline",

        "Description": "The context of this course is the changing landscape of natural heritage global commons in the preceding 10 years. During  the past few years the concept of Global Commons has extended  from  Climate and Biodiversity to  include global peace, zoonotic global pandemics like  COVID 19, Arts and Heritage and  the global financial order. A classic case of the importance of global peace as a Global Commons is that of the volatile situation created by North Korea and the Russian invasion of Ukraine  which has had ramifications across the world by way of biodiversity loss, climate change, global recession, oil price hikes. The  importance of multilateral and bilateral negotiations to resolve these issues  has been crucial. Meanwhile international financing agencies such as the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, the European Investment Bank and the Global Environmental Facility have developed  portfolios on climate change and biodiversity by way of direct investments and transfer of new patented technologies in low carbon technologies. The other significant development has been the advent  of digital ledgers like Block chains and AI and the metaverse which have found applications in the management of these global commons., View/Print Outline",

It aims to build upon the important accounting concepts and principles including revenue recognition, inventory, depreciation, and understanding the accounting equation. The course focuses initially on how to record economic events in the accounting records (i.e., bookkeeping and accrual accounting) and how to prepare and interpret the primary financial statements that summarize a firm's economic transactions (i.e., the balance sheet, the income statement, and the statement of cash flows). The course adopts a decision-maker perspective of accounting by emphasizing the relation between accounting data and the underlying economic events that generated them thereby enabling the students to read, understand and analyse financial statements through ratio analysis. The course also explores the areas of financial shenanigans wherein the students will be able to learn how companies use financial statements to disguise economic reality., View/Print Outline",

The intent is to give a foundation in design to students enrolled in any programme at the University by exposing them to the basic design fundamentals - principles, methods, processes and approaches. The course will expose the students to the user-centric approach that design adopts to address local and global challenges. They will learn to recognise that design is exploratory in nature and helps navigate ambiguity. It promotes new ways of looking at problems and coming up with solutions which are human-centered and inclusive.With practical exercises, the course will give an overview of the critical design thinking used for problem identification and opportunity mapping in any given context. Students will gain an understanding of design as a creative problem-solving tool to come up with holistic solutions for products, services, systems and experiences. The course is expected to rouse a student\u2019s interest in design. It will equip them with the necessary grounding to pursue design as a higher education or career pathway. Importantly, it will add a richer and diverse perspective to their understanding of their own field of Major education be it management, technology, sciences, humanities or social sciences.This course is open for students who are admitted to any programme at the University, View/Print Outline",

        "Description": "Visual/Creative communication in the digital age requires familiarisation and literacy that goes way beyond \u2013 beyond traditional practices. Digital is no longer a grey area. It becomes inevitable that the brand language be effectively transformed from one media to another without changing the brand image. Throughout this course, the focus would be to expose students to ideas, applications, experiences and opportunities that are relevant to today\u2019s times. This course is primarily about creating visual artefacts that communicate effectively, but that does not mean you need to be an artist to succeed. Assessment will focus upon your efforts and your willingness to engage with your classmates to provide feedback and learn from one another. The more time you spend with the exercises in this course, the more skills you will develop as a visual communicator. Take the time to explore each exercise, take risks, and reiterate often. Don\u2019t allow your first attempt at any solution to be your only attempt. Fail early and fail often. Learning what doesn\u2019t work is an essential process in understanding what does work. This course is open for students who are admitted to any programme at the University., View/Print Outline",

MUS101 tries to address these questions by exploring and interrogating the existing genres of Indian Music like Tribal-Folk, Classical-Art, Popular, Devotional and Fusion Music. It focuses on the key principles of music that formulate these genres and connect them to each other, the connection which eventually weaves the complex and diverse fabric called \u2018Indian Music\u2019. The course also tries to understand the relationship of culture and music through the dynamics of above mentioned genres. This course combines Theory and Practice thus students are expected to perform some vocals and also do some writing during the course., View/Print Outline",

In this course, students will be given an overview of the several schools (dar\u015bana) that comprise the tradition and will be introduced to some of their important doctrines, texts and thinkers. Students will be introduced to philosophical thinking and concerns (in particular ontology and epistemology, Sanskrit: prameya and pram\u0101\u1e47a respectively) by way of focusing especially on three main positions put forth in Ved\u0101nta (Advaita), Buddhism (M\u0101dhyamika) and Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika. Other main schools - C\u0101rv\u0101ka/Lok\u0101yata, Jainism, S\u0101\u1e43khya, Yoga and P\u016brvam\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 - and their positions will be discussed primarily in reference to the earlier three. Additionally, students will be introduced also to how these ancient doctrines from many millennia ago are being brought into conversation with contemporary philosophical concerns (in particular, the debate on absolutism and relativism).This is an introductory course on philosophy and no background knowledge is required. Readings during this course will be entirely in English, but several important terms from the primary languages (particularly Sanskrit) will be discussed throughout the course. Knowledge of Sanskrit is strongly encouraged., View/Print Outline",

Second, for you to formulate your own arguments about issues related to comparative politics, making use of these analytical tools and knowledge to develop and present your ideas. Hence, analytical thinking including creative and critical thinking is the most important ability which will be fully developed throughout this course. Yet, no prior knowledge on the subject is assumed nor required. The purpose of this class is to foster you to become a politically literate fledged graduate by highlighting diverse philosophic foundations of comparative politics and introducing broad and alternative methods of inquiring the study of comparative politics.

        "Description": "This course on brain and behaviour is primarily aimed at satisfying a core requirement for the psychology programme. This is the biological psychology core. It is aimed at second-year students who have no biology background beyond basic school biology. The required background will be provided as additional study material in the first two weeks of class. While psychology students are the main audience, the course serves as an introduction to neuroscience for the non-biologist and biologist alike. Thus, it is offered through the biological and life sciences programme, and will additionally serve as a campus-wide general education requirement (GER) in biology., Brain and Behaviour explores the physiological basis for psychological processes. Broadly this is the link between brain (the biological substrate) and certain functions of the brain. The course will cover innate and motivated behaviours, including sensation, motion, reproductive behaviours, perception, emotions, cognition, learning, memory, and language. Although our focus will be the \u201chuman brain\u201d other species, especially rodents and non-human primates, will be considered for comparison. The course will provide enough knowledge of biological mechanisms, with an emphasis on neural and endocrine function, as they apply to psychology and the mind-brain connection. Through this understanding, and through an understanding of various imbalances in physiology, genetics, and biological development, students will gain an understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying normal behaviour and some of its abnormalities., View/Print Outline",

        "Description": "This ENABLE course is a Major Elective for the SPS students., Cities are where future challenges lie, making them sites for various interdisciplinary investigations as well as solutions for human wellbeing and environmental sustainability. Today, more than half the world population lives in cities, creating the need for grounding of all social sciences, physical sciences, and professional works within the cities. Cities are spaces of opportunities as well as challenges given that there is no turning back the clock of history. Grounded within the Indian context, this course is divided into three broad segments that: one introduces students to important concepts and frameworks through which to understand various facets of a city; two introduces the challenges facing contemporary Indian cities and three unpack these challenges from the vantage of specific groups in the cities so as to move towards initial solutions. The challenges are presented through case studies and are related to the everyday living of urban residents with respect to employment and poverty, health, infrastructure, housing, ecology and pollution, climate change impacts, crime and violence and inequality., The course attempts to sensitise students to these challenges experienced by different populations in a city and solutions they bring on board. The sequel to this course would be towards systemic as well as decentralised solutions within the domains of urban planning and governance.  This course and its sequel will be of interest to the students thinking of future careers in urban management, urban and/ or development policies, climate change solutions, public health, media and social work sector., View/Print Outline",

        "Description": "This course introduces students to the fundamental concepts of state and society as they are understood in the social sciences and explores their mutual relationships. How have classical theories conceptualised the state and society? How is the historical evolution of the state and society in the West different from the way they have evolved in the Global South, especially in India? The big transformations in information technology and capitalism in the 21st century have fundamentally impacted the state and social interactions. Through a focus on theory and empirical studies, the course explores five key themes or dimensions of the state-society interaction: 1. What is the state?; 2. What is society?; 3. Civil Society, social movements and citizenship; 4. Sociality and politics in the age of internet; 5. State, market society and neoliberalism.   The course will explore the following questions pertaining to its five themes: 1.What are the important theoretical perspectives about the state (Weberian and Marxist)? How is the state experienced in the everyday lives of people in India?  2.What does social theory tell us about the fundamental elements of society and social life (Emile Durkheim)? What are the dominant features of pre and post-independent Indian society? 3.What is civil society and does it always strengthen democracy? How do social movements challenge the existing status quo of the state and society and when do they fail to do so?  4.How has digital media technology transformed classical notions of the public sphere and what are its implications for social relations and harmony?   5.What is market society and how has market thinking permeated social lives? What is the history and rise of neoliberalism and why is it best understood as a political project?, View/Print Outline",

Today, more than half the world population lives in cities, creating the need for grounding of all social sciences, physical sciences, and professional works within the cities. Cities are spaces of opportunities as well as challenges given that there is no turning back the clock of history. Grounded within the Indian context, this course is divided into three broad segments that: one introduces students to important concepts and frameworks through which to understand various facets of a city; two introduces the challenges facing contemporary Indian cities and three unpack these challenges from the vantage of specific groups in the cities so as to move towards initial solutions. The challenges are presented through case studies and are related to the everyday living of urban residents with respect to employment and poverty, health, infrastructure, housing, ecology and pollution, climate change impacts, crime and violence and inequality., The course attempts to sensitise students to these challenges experienced by different populations in a city and solutions they bring on board. The sequel to this course would be towards systemic as well as decentralised solutions within the domains of urban planning and governance.  This course and its sequel will be of interest to the students thinking of future careers in urban management, urban and/ or development policies, climate change solutions, public health, media and social work sector., View/Print Outline",

        "Description": "This course introduces students to one of the ways in which we acquire knowledge about the world\u2014Doing Research. Research is an attempt to understand the world through systematic study\u2014that is, through identification of a problem, question, or hypothesis; selection of methods to investigate the question, collecting data, interpreting data, and reporting findings. The process of designing and doing research is a mix of various elements including the world view and social location of the researcher (researcher positionality), the selection of what one wants to investigate (research problem/question), and how one goes about doing it (research methods). This introductory and project-based course will familiarize students with the philosophical underpinnings of research, and enable them to identify, compare and contrast different qualitative and quantitative research methods suitable for answering a question, apply their understanding to design a research project in small groups, collect and analyse data, and demonstrate basics of academic writing., View/Print Outline",

        "Description": "SPS301 History of the \u2018Social\u2019 is a core course for SPS Major, and can also be counted towards a minor in SPS. Although the course is located within SPS, it will also be of interest to students in PHL, and other majors, as it broadly deals with the making and applicability of concepts.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The course invites students from different disciplines to engage with the project of turning the \u2018social\u2019 into an object of inquiry. Building on the sense that though freely used in everyday life the word \u2018social\u2019 is little understood, the course will enable students to ask what makes a phenomena, a process, an event or a form of knowledge \u2018social\u2019. They will be able to ask and address questions such as, Do only human beings have society? How does one theorise something that is seemingly so near to us? And, why to theorise it in the first place? What is theory? Etc.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The course will open up these possibilities by introducing students to the various ways in which the \u2018social\u2019 has been broached and understood, particularly in the domain of inquiry we refer to as social theory. Students will learn to evaluate and apply theoretical perspectives to the world around them, and to appreciate both the possibilities and limitations of theorising as a way of understanding. The course has been designed in a way that students get a sense of the \u2018social\u2019 as a problem and not just as an abstract concept. They will get to see how various forms of social explanation developed in response to specific problems, and hence, how to assess them accordingly. The tensions and possibilities residing in each approach to the \u2018social\u2019 will be laid bare, enabling students to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each. They will be able to critically assess which of these approaches suits their own research interests best, and to use it productively and with awareness.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It is a reading intensive course and students will be expected to consistently work on challenging texts by major social theorists, anthropologists and historians. A typical class meeting will consist of lecturing, reading together as a class and discussion., View/Print Outline",

        "Description": "This course delves into the formation of the modern Hindi imagination through the influential works of Premchand, one of the most significant writers in Hindi and Urdu literature. His writings shaped the literary landscape of the Hindi-Urdu-speaking world and encapsulated the evolving hopes, struggles, and social consciousness of his time. By engaging with his works, students will explore how Premchand's storytelling contributed to the broader cultural and intellectual fabric of Hindi-speaking society.The course will approach Premchand's literature through two critical frameworks. The first will contextualize his work within the historical backdrop of the Indian national movement, with a particular emphasis on Gandhi's Hindustani ideals and the socio-political currents of the time. The second framework will bring Premchand's reflections on pressing issues such as caste, class, gender, communalism, and nationalism into dialogue with contemporary debates, highlighting the enduring relevance of his literary contributions.Premchand's ability to straddle the worlds of both Hindi and Urdu literature makes him a vital figure for understanding the composite culture of North India. By examining his work, students will gain new perspectives on the historical roots of today's social issues and the role of literature in shaping collective imagination., View/Print Outline",

Through focus on concepts of \u2018contour\u2019, \u2018gesture\u2019 and \u2018structure\u2019, students will learn how to draw a human figure both from direct observation and from memory, while also understanding the significance of a human figure in the global history of art through intellectual discourse. Students will learn to render a human figure through in-depth study of skeletal structure and muscles by using mediums including graphite, charcoal and paint (acrylic) and also paper and canvas as support., Beginning with simple gestural drawings, the course will help students understand how one or more human figures work in a composition, while also exploring descriptive poses, moving action, and group poses. The studio sessions will be spent making drawings of human figures from direct observation, and reference images including images captured by students and artworks by master artists. The reference artworks by master artists will include the ones who drew and painted in a classical style and the ones who explored human figure beyond the conventions of traditional style and ventured into abstraction., There will be ongoing guidance and critique of works-in-progress, and discussions of finished works, which will touch upon concepts crucial to the creative process, including emphasis on hand-eye coordination, critical thinking, and spontaneity. This will also be supplemented with museum and gallery visits in Ahmedabad., Sketchbooks will be an important component in this course; students will explore self-expression and alternative drawing methods as a part of their required initiative., View/Print Outline",

Making use of ethnographies, letters, memoirs, and autobiographies, students will engage writings on caste both as subject and method. What does it mean to write about caste in the contemporary? How do they inform one another? Rather than demonstrate a customary prevalence of caste in the present-day, the course explores the contours of contemporary theory the lens of caste. The experiential alongside anthropological modes of understanding serve as interrogative strands throughout the course. When it is not reduced to a singular concept around time, the contemporary becomes a unique vantage point to critically locate how we have come to inhabit the social and the ethical. Further, the course is designed to bring in global perspectives around caste and does not limit it to an isolated regional phenomenon.The course is valuable to students who are interested in questions around social hierarchy, ethics, and experience., View/Print Outline",

The course introduces students to caste, as an analytical category in studying social and cultural processes., Making use of ethnographies, letters, memoirs, and autobiographies, students will engage writings on caste both as subject and method. What, does it mean to write about caste in the contemporary? How do they, inform one another? Rather than demonstrate a customary prevalence of, caste in the present-day, the course explores the contours of caste and, contemporary theories. The experiential alongside anthropological, modes of understanding serve as interrogative strands throughout the, course. When it is not reduced to a singular concept around linear time, the contemporary is no longer a singular event. How does one locate the, ways in which we come to inhabit the social and the ethical in these, moments of flux? Further, the course is designed to bring in global, perspectives around caste and does not limit it to an isolated regional, phenomenon. The course is valuable to students who are interested in questions around social hierarchy, ethics, and experience. Graduate, students will take up a project that connects to their larger thesis and, work towards understanding how inequality is part of the contemporary, in the most intricate of ways., View/Print Outline",

Scenic design would teach scene design specific to theatre. The course has been structured to have a holistic approach to the idea of creation and design. Focus would remain heavy on learning the \u2018process\u2019 that one must go through to create; building a base, a backstory, researching, rejecting and revisiting during the process of ideation.Following is the breakdown of how the course is structured: - Movement and composition in acting - Acting and Space design - Creating images from text - Light design - Set design - Sound and music - 3D mapping as new technology - Design principles in scenography - Types of theatres and theatre architecture, View/Print Outline",

        "Description": "The course invites students from different disciplines to engage with the project of turning the \u2018social\u2019 into an object of inquiry. Building on the sense that though freely used in everyday life the word \u2018social\u2019 is little understood, the course will enable students to ask what makes a phenomena, a process, an event or a form of knowledge \u2018social\u2019. They will be able to ask and address questions such as, Do only human beings have society? How does one theorise something that is seemingly so near to us? And, why to theorise it in the first place? What is theory? Etc.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The course will open up these possibilities by introducing students to the various ways in which the \u2018social\u2019 has been broached and understood, particularly in the domain of inquiry we refer to as social theory. Students will learn to evaluate and apply theoretical perspectives to the world around them, and to appreciate both the possibilities and limitations of theorising as a way of understanding. The course has been designed in a way that students get a sense of the \u2018social\u2019 as a problem and not just as an abstract concept. They will get to see how various forms of social explanation developed in response to specific problems, and hence, how to assess them accordingly. The tensions and possibilities residing in each approach to the \u2018social\u2019 will be laid bare, enabling students to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each. They will be able to critically assess which of these approaches suits their own research interests best, and to use it productively and with awareness.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is a reading intensive course and students will be expected to consistently work on challenging texts by major social theorists, anthropologists and historians. A typical class meeting will consist of lecturing, reading together as a class and discussion., View/Print Outline",

        "Description": "History is more than a list of facts, names, dates, and places. It is a complex set of variables, causalities, decisions, relationships, and improbable coincidences.The Sweep of History aims to introduce students to at least 13.8 billion years of history and think about the future through the course of 25 moments in time and space, beginning with the Big Bang and ending with a contemplation of the death of the world as we know it. The overarching theme may seem to be inevitable human progress and an increasingly globalized world, but we\u2019ll see that this is only one narrative among many others. Likewise, the only actors in this drama may seem to be humans, but we\u2019ll also try to think about the role of Nature in history.The Sweep of History is not intended to be a comprehensive history of everything. Rather think of this as a process of discovery as we explore various themes. But this also as an introduction into history as a discipline. You will explore the methods of the historian: how does the historian grapple with their position in time and in the world? How does the historian reconstruct the past? How does the historian narrate the past (and think about the present and the future)? The assignments and final project will allow you to experience first hand what it means to do history., View/Print Outline",

The course attempts to dwell on both parts, as the latter is important in initiating, and refining the other part. The course will start from explaining what is research, the several steps involved in doing scientific research starting from identification of a problem, question, or hypothesis, reviewing the existing literature to rationalize the problem, selection of methods to investigate the question, collecting data, interpreting data using quantitative analyses and reporting findings. Each step will be accompanied by demo data sets and case studies, to provide doctoral students a flavor of designing and conducting research., View/Print Outline",

Students will learn about cartesian and non-cartesian space(s), and explore how space as an analytic category might be used to ask and answer interesting research questions. Methodologically, students will learn how maps work, where mapped data come from, and how maps contribute to the analysis of social phenomena across fields such as urban planning, history, public health, and business. Importantly, students will develop quantitative literacy by learning how to acquire spatial data, make maps, critically evaluate what is mapped and what is not, as well as derive spatial relationships between multiple types of information., View/Print Outline",

        "Description": "This is an upper level core course designed for students taking the SPS major, although it is open to all senior undergraduates and masters students. Ravaged by colonialism, India was born with extreme poverty and social inequalities. At independence, policymakers faced tough decisions in social and economic policy \u2013 many of which would be amended in the years to come. The second half of the 20th century was a period of great ferment, in which scholars around the world, occupying the spectrum from communist and socialist to neo-liberalism, debated how to best structure an economy and its consequences for social inequalities. This class offers a comprehensive view on the debates that animated economic policy at independence, and continue to animate policy decisions today. The course begins with theoretical debates on the nature of the market and how they shaped India\u2019s first economic policies. It takes us through the 1991 market reforms in India, and new policy innovations thereafter. The second half of the course deals with contemporary challenges and how they relate to the market, from gender, caste, religious and class inequalities to climate change., View/Print Outline",

        "Description": "This course is designed as a graduate-level entry point into the complex interplay between modernity, mass atrocity, and the evolution of the international human rights regime. It begins with an exploration of the theoretical and philosophical underpinnings of violence, through which students reflect on the nature of evil, the dissolution of distinct conceptual categories related to mass atrocities (such as \u201cvictim\u201d versus \u201cperpetrator\u201d), and modernity as the \u201cnecessary condition\u201d for mass violence. It interrogates the role of empire, race, and colonialism at the foundation of international law and international relations and focuses on their continued legacies in contemporary conflicts.\u00a0 Taking stock of developments in international legal norms and human rights since the middle of the 20th century, the course then seeks to generate an understanding of the international community's response to international crimes such as genocide, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity. Finally, the course critically analyses the paradoxes within the current human rights regime, the role of gender in mass violence, and the emerging concept of \u201cecocide as genocide\u201d in the context of climate change. Drawing from political theory, philosophy, international relations, and sociology, this course can be expected to appeal to students interested in history, sociology, international relations, human rights, and international law., View/Print Outline",

Physical, chemical and biological properties will be discussed. These properties will be connected with the science of material structure, such as, crystals and grains, at different length scales. Standards of materials designation will be introduced, as also how these materials are available in the market. Hands-on laboratory work will give experience of measuring material properties, and structure of materials. Engineering uses and environmental aspects of the products will be integrated into the course.",

The second phase, includes development of concept deigns, evaluation of alternative designs, and concept design finalization. Various design techniques, e.g. TRIZ, Poka Yoke, FMEA, etc. and materials selection using CES are used to prepare engineering drawings resulting in a complete engineering design including Bill of Materials (BoM). To realize the design, techniques of DFM, DFA, are applied and manufacturing drawings are prepared. After making or buying the components, the assembly is carried out to realize the proof-of-concept. After testing, the products are displayed in an expo. Finally, manuals are prepared, and recyclability aspects are addressed.",
