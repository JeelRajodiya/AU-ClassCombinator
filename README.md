# Course Combinator v2.0

I originally built this project for my freshman CSE100 course. Due to its utility, it quickly gained popularity at Ahmedabad University, serving over **1,000 students** to date. With consistent traffic maintained over three years, I decided to rewrite the entire application from scratch using **Vue.js** to ensure better performance and an enhanced user experience

Live demo is available at https://classcombinator.vercel.app

The project is still actively maintained because so many people continue to find it useful. If you like the project, **please give it a star on GitHub and share it with your friends!**

Older version (v1.0) is available at [v1 branch](https://github.com/JeelRajodiya/AU-ClassCombinator/tree/v1?tab=readme-ov-file)
