The Competition Commission\u2019s intervention or NCLT\u2019s ruling make further additions to the M&A news. M&As are the causes and results of corporate restructuring necessitated by both ups and downs of the national economy. The managements of the merging companies defend their M&A decisions. The employees become uneasy and skeptical about their future. The stock market reacts positively or negatively. While the overt motives behind many mergers are \u2018growth\u2019 through organic or inorganic combinations, the covert purposes can be driven by \u2018managerial hubris\u2019. But the fact remains; most M&As are failing sooner or later as the mysterious M&A chemistry is less understood. The failure rates are more in developing economies, even though successful CEOs strike the deals. Experts are unanimous in expressing that majority of failed mergers are the results of unscientific M&A decisions but it remains an exotic bets; win some lose some.",

Projects are vital and often businesses and various functions start with this management operation. Initial activities within a function also start with projects, for eg.

This is designed specifically for the Heritage Management students, and is to be offered in the final semester of the programme. The idea behind this course is not to \u2018teach\u2019 a particular way of professional practice and or a set of ethics, but to make students aware of multiple fields of practice in different settings, and to sensitize them on potential roles, responsibilities, rights as well as ethical concerns that may come in such fields of practices \u2013 particularly keeping in mind their own scenarios or career plans as they graduate from the Masters degree in Heritage Management.Heritage is a broad concept connecting to various disciplines and almost all levels of society. Heritage Management is an evolving field of practice which aims to keep the heritage idea in focus while working in development, planning, economic activities, community development, research and institution building etc. Hence, there are multiple avenues of practice that the graduates of the Heritage management programme may pursue \u2013 from being an individual heritage professional to taking a leading position in a heritage related organization, from setting up their own entrepreneurial business to venturing into a large scale corporate type set up tapping into any sector of heritage, i.e. textile or metal work etc., from joining a government department to working in the NGO sector, from being an administrator in a local urban body to being an academician, and so on. Accordingly, it comes with its own complexities and potential conflicts of interests too. It is in such contexts that this course aims to highlight the potential overlaps, conflict of interests, individual and societal rights, organizational behavior and ethics etc. that may be relevant to heritage practitioners. This is not an exclusive course to cover all possible topics and areas \u2013 which perhaps is impossible, but this is a course to trigger such sensitivities in the minds of future heritage managers, and to enable them to explore such issues and be prepared to frame their career plan and professional activities in a more just and responsible ways.",

It is also important for individuals who create any original work, be it in the scientific, literary, or cultural domain. Intellectual property rights are considered monopolistic rights, but the monopoly is a limited one as the IPRs will go in the public domain after a certain stipulated time. The ethical implications of the IPRs will be discussed and deliberated during the course through various case studies where monopolistic presence versus the social benefits are in conflict especially pharmaceutical products and/or utilitarian goods. The course will familiarize students with the popular types of intellectual properties and the legal provisions related to them and the administrative remedies which can be sought for. With the advent of technology, intellectual property protection has become a challenge due to piracy. The course deals with the technological solutions to the sustainable inventions and whether they can be protected through IPRs or not he course also looks into the contemporary issues of Intellectual Property rights in the global context.

Answers to these questions are not simple, and there scarcely exists a unique solution for any one of them. Nevertheless, principles of economics, both micro and macro, often provide an interesting and effective framework on which the logic of international economic issues can be constructed.\u00a0 \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t         EPP530 International Economics provides an insight into some of these principles and equips graduate students with the understanding of the functioning of the economies in a globalized world.

How have the Indian values and socio-cultural perspectives been informed by the stories and anecdotes from the two great Sanskrit epics?

And, more importantly, how can cultural organisations identify, understand and respond to the ongoing change? The course aims at providing the theoretical models and practical tools that would enable cultural organisations to manage change, benefiting from some of the latest developments in the areas of business management, strategy and marketing.  In this context, the key challenges for cultural organisations are to: \u2022 be agile in the changing and fluid environment;  \u2022 achieve and sustain innovation over time; and  \u2022 maintain and increase their visitors and networks, securing financial viability and also contributing to the development of the local and the broader community.  A wide range of cultural organisations, international and Asian and Indian ones, from both the public and the private sector are used as case studies. The ultimate aim of the course is to contribute to the shaping of the heritage managers of tomorrow.",

Theories and models in urban planning and design would be covered followed by a discussion on alternative urban development approaches and formulation of urban and transport infrastructure policy, and a liberal planning framework.  The objective of Module-2: Urban transport is to introduce urban transport infrastructure planning, design, and management.  Public transport, which is instrumental in a city\u2019s socioeconomic development, will be a key focus.  Various debates and topical issues surrounding urban planning and transport will be covered by critical review assignments.",

Against the backdrop of Neoclassical economics (specifically Expected Utility Theory), this course will discuss deviations from the standard concepts of individual preferences, beliefs, and decision-making processes. In doing so, we will see that people are loss-averse, present-biased, more social, and often use heuristics in their decision-making. Experimental evidence from education, labour, health, public economics/finance and development economics will elucidate these ideas.  More broadly, this course will provide students with an overview of how researchers and policymakers have leveraged their understanding of behavioural and experimental economics to study and find solutions to fix undesirable or less desirable individual decisions (from a social planner\u2019s perspective). Considering that this is an introductory course, the theory and experiments will be discussed with a greater focus on intuition and a lesser emphasis on the technicalities. The mathematical technicalities, along with the fine details behind the design of an experiment, could be worked upon in a more advanced level course on experimental and/or behavioural economics.",

Although India is a small market for luxury goods currently (projected value of $8.5 billion in 2023), according to this report, it could reach up to $200 billion by 2030. Apple opened two stores in India this year, Louis Vuitton roped in Deepika Padukone as its first-ever Indian house ambassador, Gucci appointed Alia Bhatt as its first global ambassador from India, and Dior held its first-ever fashion show in India. These and other developments show that the Indian luxury market is ready to take off. This has been possible because of a large number of young, educated, and economically well-off Indian consumers who are exposed to global luxury brands and want to enjoy and showcase their success by buying luxury goods.\n\nIn this course, Marketing Luxury Brands, the students will learn to analyze and understand the marketing mix applied to managing luxury brands. Students will learn about the sociological and psychological factors that shape the behavior of luxury consumers. They will learn what makes a product a luxury brand, where these brands are sold, and how the messaging is different for luxury brands. This course also has a set of case studies that will help the students learn to analyze real-world marketing scenarios involving luxury brands.",

During  the past few years the concept of Global Commons has extended  from  Climate and Biodiversity to  include global peace, zoonotic global pandemics like  COVID 19 , Arts and Heritage and  the global financial order. A classic case of the importance of global peace as a Global Commons is that of the volatile situation created by North Korea and the Russian invasion of Ukraine  which has had ramifications across the world by way of biodiversity loss , climate change ,global recession, oil price hikes. The  importance of multilateral and bilateral negotiations to resolve these issues  has been crucial. Meanwhile international financing agencies such as the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, the European Investment Bank and the Global Environmental Facility have developed  portfolios on climate change and biodiversity by way of direct investments and transfer of new patented technologies in low carbon technologies. The other significant development has been the advent  of digital ledgers like Block chains and AI and the metaverse which have found applications in the management of these global commons.",

The students are introduced to municipal corporation and municipality laws, urban planning laws, solid waste management rules, street vendors\u2019 legislation, and financial instruments available for urban management. Finally, students will be introduced to the impacts of climate change on heritage areas.\n\nThe students will work through the course at three levels. The first level is they will be introduced to theoretical debates on urban governance in India. The second level is they will read the relevant legislation for different states in India to be introduced to the federal nature of urban planning and governance in India. The third level is taking the example of a heritage neighbourhood in Ahmedabad will analyse various aspects of urban governance and propose solutions to the governance challenges using relevant legislation. At the city level, the students will also map the current institutional structures of heritage management. The neighbourhood selection should include residential neighborhoods along with heritage precincts of Grade I or II. The final output will be a Heritage Management Plan for the selected neighbourhood.",

The intent is to get the perspective of the investor in this space and learn how these investment firms are structured and what their business models are. They will learn the basics of due diligence, valuation and deal structuring. The students will learn about team building, effective communication and negotiation with internal and external stakeholders through case study assignments. They will learn how to make a pitch on behalf of a startup as well as how to evaluate a pitch on behalf of the investors by participating in classroom case study exercises. \nIndia is witnessing a boom in investments by venture capital and private equity firms post COVID in terms of doubling of investment teams by top funds in 2019-2023 period (Bain & Company\u2019s Global Private Equity Report, 2024). The first half of 2024 has shown a clear trend towards hiring in key areas that support technology, operational efficiency, ESG initiatives, healthcare innovation and financial strategy, as per a study by Prequin (Prequin Private Capital Compensation and Employment Review 2024 by Ferguson Partners) shows that 54% of private equity firms plan to increase the hiring of finance professionals in 2024 to support their growth and expansion strategies. It is desirable for the MBA and MSQF students to have an exposure to the Private Equity industry.\nIn the Indian context, in the recent years the relevance of small and medium enterprises for development has become particularly noteworthy. As these firms are more constrained than large firms in terms of access to financial capital, venture capital and private equity play a vital role in constituting a valuable resource for a firm\u2019s growth, especially for the more innovative SMEs, so that they can support economic development and innovation in the economy. Private Equity is considered an important element of a good entrepreneurial eco-system and a critical source of finance for start-ups, growing companies and for takeover transactions",

It aims to build upon the important accounting concepts and principles including revenue recognition, inventory, depreciation, and understanding the accounting equation. The course focuses initially on how to record economic events in the accounting records (i.e., bookkeeping and accrual accounting) and how to prepare and interpret the primary financial statements that summarize a firm's economic transactions (i.e., the balance sheet, the income statement, and the statement of cash flows). The course adopts a decision-maker perspective of accounting by emphasizing the relation between accounting data and the underlying economic events that generated them thereby enabling the students to read, understand and analyse financial statements through ratio analysis. The course also explores the areas of financial shenanigans wherein the students will be able to learn how companies use financial statements to disguise economic reality.",

Very occasionally when \u2018culture\u2019 does figure, it has a designated space, isolated from the everyday permeation of culture in just about everything we see or do. Through a series of illustrations from media, art, rituals on one hand and ordinary situations when the \u2018cultural\u2019 asserts itself both overtly and covertly, on the other hand, the course hopes to make students aware of every situation that has a cultural dimension even when we least expect it to be.",

In this sense, organisations are not merely seen as a place where communication happens, but it exists because employees communicate and create the sense in the existing structure. Also, the idea of the workplace has moved beyond the simple \"office space\" to \"living social networks\" that combine work, home and play. Moreover, organisations use their website and social media to communicate with internal and external stakeholders. Viewed, thus, in this context, the course looks at the constitutive view of communication and intends to familiarise students with workplace communications as practised in the corporate world. The course is interdisciplinary and involves the combination of concepts (communication, sociology and computer-mediated technology) into one project.",

In doing so, students are introduced to the various types of derivative instruments available in the marketplace, their applications, and the associated market structures and price mechanisms that govern these instruments. Furthermore, students are introduced to relevant risk management strategies that market participants can implement at various levels of the value chain to mitigate different risks.India now ranks among the global leaders in derivatives trading activity. Consequently, this course is also designed to make students appreciate the opportunities and challenges with respect to Indian & Global derivative markets, without losing sight of the regulatory actions that have enabled the prevalence of the derivatives market in the first place.  This course enables students to master the analytical tools (valuation, hedging, and pricing) of derivatives, with a strong emphasis on quantitative techniques and practical applications in global and Indian markets.",

        "description": "In the contemporary age of increasing integration among the economies of the world, questions such as why and how countries trade with one another, how international capital flows are decided, how do indigenous firms compete against the mighty multinational corporations, the relevance of interest and inflation rate differentials, how the international value of currency gets decided, and many more, call for the attention of students of Economics. Answers to these questions are not simple, and there scarcely exists a unique solution for any one of them. Nevertheless, principles of Economics, both Micro and Macro, often provide an interesting and effective framework on which the logic of international economic issues can be constructed.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t         International Economics provides an insight into some of these principles and equips undergraduate students in the field of management with the understanding of the functioning of the economies in a globalized world. The course covers essential theories of International Economics as well as empirical analysis of some of the most important global events that have altered the way in which economies have functioned over the last few decades.",

Conventionally the three themes; energy, environment and sustainability; are perceived through the lens of trade-offs. This perspective is changing in recent times. Policymakers, professionals and civil society actors are cooperating to align strategies and actions across themes to overcome societal and individual risks and to gain co-benefits and comparative advantage. In many environmentally proactive entities, \u201csustainability\u201d is a core issue that is increasingly integrated with organizational processes, systems and strategies. Delineation of policies to align energy, environment and sustainability is a highly explored subject drawing interest from researchers and practitioners. The course is divided into four modules which combine distinct yet inter-related concepts around the three central themes. The sessions cover the landscape ranging from global, national to local, spanning technologies, management and concepts from social sciences and ecology.\u00a0Objectives\u2022\tIntroduce the energy, environment and sustainability themes and their nexus;\u00a0\u2022\tExplore the contemporary perspectives and approaches to sustainability;\u2022\tAssess practical frameworks for aligning the policies and actions to maximize welfare of present and future generations;\u2022\tDelineate the mix of policy and technology innovations to harmonize the environment, energy and sustainability nexus into the future.",

Consumers often make irrational choices. Decisions are based on emotions and unconscious motivations \u2013 not only on rational logic. Consumer choices are implicit not explicit. Consumers cannot often express their motivations in response to traditional marketing research surveys. This is because consumers either won\u2019t say why they made some choices (as the answers might not sound logical and reasonable) or they can\u2019t say (as choices were made at an unconscious level and they themselves do not know why they choose a brand). The course will draw on the works of several neuroscientists and behavioural economists like Daniel Kahneman, Richard Thaler, and Dan Ariely. We will use behavioural economics experiments (\u2018Nudge\u2019 as Richard Thaler calls it) to see how subtle interventions influence brand choices. We will explore how ethnography \u2013 a method of immersing oneself in consumer lives (used in anthropology and sociology) \u2013 can help us get under the skin of the consumer and observe the role of products and brands in consumer life, as lived and not as claimed in surveys.",

The intent is to give a foundation in design to students enrolled in any programme at the University by exposing them to the basic design fundamentals - principles, methods, processes and approaches. The course will expose the students to the user-centric approach that design adopts to address local and global challenges. They will learn to recognise that design is exploratory in nature and helps navigate ambiguity. It promotes new ways of looking at problems and coming up with solutions which are human-centered and inclusive.With practical exercises, the course will give an overview of the critical design thinking used for problem identification and opportunity mapping in any given context. Students will gain an understanding of design as a creative problem-solving tool to come up with holistic solutions for products, services, systems and experiences. The course is expected to rouse a student\u2019s interest in design. It will equip them with the necessary grounding to pursue design as a higher education or career pathway. Importantly, it will add a richer and diverse perspective to their understanding of their own field of Major education be it management, technology, sciences, humanities or social sciences.This course is open for students who are admitted to any programme at the University",

Digital is no longer a grey area. It becomes inevitable that the brand language be effectively transformed from one media to another without changing the brand image. Throughout this course, the focus would be to expose students to ideas, applications, experiences and opportunities that are relevant to today\u2019s times. This course is primarily about creating visual artefacts that communicate effectively, but that does not mean you need to be an artist to succeed. Assessment will focus upon your efforts and your willingness to engage with your classmates to provide feedback and learn from one another. The more time you spend with the exercises in this course, the more skills you will develop as a visual communicator. Take the time to explore each exercise, take risks, and reiterate often. Don\u2019t allow your first attempt at any solution to be your only attempt. Fail early and fail often. Learning what doesn\u2019t work is an essential process in understanding what does work. This course is open for students who are admitted to any programme at the University.",

It is aimed at second-year students who have no biology background beyond basic school biology. The required background will be provided as additional study material in the first two weeks of class. While psychology students are the main audience, the course serves as an introduction to neuroscience for the non-biologist and biologist alike. Thus, it is offered through the biological and life sciences programme, and will additionally serve as a campus-wide general education requirement (GER) in biology.  \nBrain and Behaviour explores the physiological basis for psychological processes. Broadly this is the link between brain (the biological substrate) and certain functions of the brain. The course will cover innate and motivated behaviours, including sensation, motion, reproductive behaviours, perception, emotions, cognition, learning, memory, and language. Although our focus will be the \u201chuman brain\u201d other species, especially rodents and non-human primates, will be considered for comparison. The course will provide enough knowledge of biological mechanisms, with an emphasis on neural and endocrine function, as they apply to psychology and the mind-brain connection. Through this understanding, and through an understanding of various imbalances in physiology, genetics, and biological development, students will gain an understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying normal behaviour and some of its abnormalities.",

Cities are spaces of opportunities as well as challenges given that there is no turning back the clock of history. Grounded within the Indian context, this course is divided into three broad segments that: one introduces students to important concepts and frameworks through which to understand various facets of a city; two introduces the challenges facing contemporary Indian cities and three unpack these challenges from the vantage of specific groups in the cities so as to move towards initial solutions. The challenges are presented through case studies and are related to the everyday living of urban residents with respect to employment and poverty, health, infrastructure, housing, ecology and pollution, climate change impacts, crime and violence and inequality. \nThe course attempts to sensitise students to these challenges experienced by different populations in a city and solutions they bring on board. The sequel to this course would be towards systemic as well as decentralised solutions within the domains of urban planning and governance.  This course and its sequel will be of interest to the students thinking of future careers in urban management, urban and/ or development policies, climate change solutions, public health, media and social work sector.",

        "description": "This course introduces students to the fundamental concepts of state and society as they are understood in the social sciences and explores their mutual relationships. How have classical theories conceptualised the state and society? How is the historical evolution of the state and society in the West different from the way they have evolved in the Global South, especially in India? The big transformations in information technology and capitalism in the 21st century have fundamentally impacted the state and social interactions. Through a focus on theory and empirical studies, the course explores five key themes or dimensions of the state-society interaction: 1. What is the state?; 2. What is society?; 3. Civil Society, social movements and citizenship; 4. Sociality and politics in the age of internet; 5. State, market society and neoliberalism.   The course will explore the following questions pertaining to its five themes: 1.\tWhat are the important theoretical perspectives about the state (Weberian and Marxist)? How is the state experienced in the everyday lives of people in India?  2.\tWhat does social theory tell us about the fundamental elements of society and social life (Emile Durkheim)? What are the dominant features of pre and post-independent Indian society? 3.\tWhat is civil society and does it always strengthen democracy? How do social movements challenge the existing status quo of the state and society and when do they fail to do so?  4.\tHow has digital media technology transformed classical notions of the public sphere and what are its implications for social relations and harmony?   5.\tWhat is market society and how has market thinking permeated social lives? What is the history and rise of neoliberalism and why is it best understood as a political project?",

We interpret actions and events in our everyday lives, as also literary creations like poems and plays, sacred books, archives, and the law. What does it mean to interpret a text? First of all, what is a text? Is it merely something written, or can anything that has meaning for us be considered a text? Is there a difference between interpretation, explanation, and our everyday understanding of the world? Is there a particular method, like the scientific method, that we can apply to interpret a text? Are some readings of a text better than others? Can an interpretation ever be universal? How should we conceive of language in the process of interpretation? We will engage with such questions in conversation with some key readings from the modern Western hermeneutical tradition.",

The students will be introduced to the fundamental concepts, principles and theories in social psychology to then review these in light of the changing times that we live in. The course introduces the idea of social psychologies getting refracted in different social, political and cultural contexts as contrasted to a default universal social psychology. After setting the tone, the course discusses the research methods in social psychology critiquing some key studies as required, while also identifying the advances in social cognition through neuroscience research. The key elements of the study are individual cognition, affect and behavior in the implied and/or actual presence of others, interpersonal behavior- principles and theories therein, esp., focusing on pro-social behavior and aggression and group processes, where the key step level changes that happen in human behavior as a consequence of group affiliation. Throughout the course, applications in different contexts, with an interdisciplinary lens, are introduced and examined in detail.",

        "description": "This course surveys the empire in Indian history. It looks at the history of empires, the ideas of political elites and their relationships with other groups. How did entanglements between rulers and ruled help Indians imagine themselves? The course also looks at territory, trade, taxation and redistribution. What role did the natural environment, political culture and diverse communities play in the emergence and functioning of the empire? Finally, it asks how Indian society has been shaped by the legacy of empire. It introduces the key issues surrounding the processes of state formation and empire building.Due to British colonial high-handedness and the bitter experiences of decolonisation movements, the term empire acquired a negative connotation. The empire wasn't necessarily bad. For about two millennia, Indians have lived in one empire or another. The modern nation-state is new. It is a concept that came from Europe in the 19th century. In many ways, the nation-state seems inadequate to meet the needs of a 'civilisational state', i.e. India, with its enormous diversity. A more nuanced understanding of contemporary Indian society can emerge from a discussion of empire, imperial institutions and their legacies.",

Today, more than half the world population lives in cities, creating the need for grounding of all social sciences, physical sciences, and professional works within the cities. Cities are spaces of opportunities as well as challenges given that there is no turning back the clock of history. Grounded within the Indian context, this course is divided into three broad segments that: one introduces students to important concepts and frameworks through which to understand various facets of a city; two introduces the challenges facing contemporary Indian cities and three unpack these challenges from the vantage of specific groups in the cities so as to move towards initial solutions. The challenges are presented through case studies and are related to the everyday living of urban residents with respect to employment and poverty, health, infrastructure, housing, ecology and pollution, climate change impacts, crime and violence and inequality. \n\nThe course attempts to sensitise students to these challenges experienced by different populations in a city and solutions they bring on board. The sequel to this course would be towards systemic as well as decentralised solutions within the domains of urban planning and governance.  This course and its sequel will be of interest to the students thinking of future careers in urban management, urban and/ or development policies, climate change solutions, public health, media and social work sector.",

We will read these primary sources in the original (and in the case of Hind Swaraj, in translation) to explore the divergent ideas of India that emerged through the writings of the three barristers, wherein categories such as caste, nation, and people became contested. We will locate these texts \u2013 and the writers \u2013 within the wider context of British colonialism and the conversations surrounding emergent nationhood. Along with the primary texts, we will also read a few contemporary scholarly works on these texts and their authors, such as Ajay Skaria (2016), Anupama Rao (2009), and Joseph Alter (2000), among others.",

It is a survey course that extensively reviews the various aspects of the British colonial rule over the Indian subcontinent. The period covered is roughly between 1850s to 1940s. In the first couple of weeks, we will acquaint ourselves with the state and society in the Indian subcontinent before the advent of the colonial rule. However, the bulk of the course will examine in detail the impact of British imperial rule on India. We will explore the major political, social and cultural events with a focus on three themes: Caste, Print media and Nation. We will examine the emergence of caste as a form of politics; as an ideological battle-ground; and as a discourse. We will also engage with different vernacular publics that emerged through the rise of print in the nineteenth century India to explore the circulation and dissemination of the idea of the Indian nation. Gender and religion will be some of the other overlapping themes we will explore.",

Although the course is located within SPS, it will also be of interest to students in PHL, and other majors, as it broadly deals with the making and applicability of concepts.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The course invites students from different disciplines to engage with the project of turning the \u2018social\u2019 into an object of inquiry. Building on the sense that though freely used in everyday life the word \u2018social\u2019 is little understood, the course will enable students to ask what makes a phenomena, a process, an event or a form of knowledge \u2018social\u2019. They will be able to ask and address questions such as, Do only human beings have society? How does one theorise something that is seemingly so near to us? And, why to theorise it in the first place? What is theory? Etc.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The course will open up these possibilities by introducing students to the various ways in which the \u2018social\u2019 has been broached and understood, particularly in the domain of inquiry we refer to as social theory. Students will learn to evaluate and apply theoretical perspectives to the world around them, and to appreciate both the possibilities and limitations of theorising as a way of understanding. The course has been designed in a way that students get a sense of the \u2018social\u2019 as a problem and not just as an abstract concept. They will get to see how various forms of social explanation developed in response to specific problems, and hence, how to assess them accordingly. The tensions and possibilities residing in each approach to the \u2018social\u2019 will be laid bare, enabling students to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each. They will be able to critically assess which of these approaches suits their own research interests best, and to use it productively and with awareness.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It is a reading intensive course and students will be expected to consistently work on challenging texts by major social theorists, anthropologists and historians. A typical class meeting will consist of lecturing, reading together as a class and discussion.",

It can be chosen by all students, who are able to complete the prerequisites. Positive Psychology is the scientific enquiry of aspects of human experience which create and cultivate  joy and well-being. This growing and much delayed field of psychology exerts a very strong influence on several applied fields of psychology, which traditionally have been focused on what is \u2018wrong\u2019 with human experience. The present course will introduce the theory and practice of positive psychology which includes philosophical foundations of positive psychology, understandings of positive strengths and virtues, well-being through life span and applications. Alongside learning the theoretical concepts, the students will also have the opportunity to work through one\u2019s own strengths through group projects. The course is designed with an applied orientation in intersections with health, clinical, counselling and sports psychology.",

        "description": "This course is the second of a set of two courses (other being SAN201) which initiates students into the discipline of reading original Sanskrit texts. Students have been introduced to the intricacies of Sanskrit morphology and syntax in SAN101 and SAN102, and students began to read original, albeit relatively simpler, texts in SAN201. This course SAN202 concludes two years of Sanskrit study at the University, and thereby aims to bring students to a level where they will be self-sufficient in being able to continue their journey in the vast world of classical Sanskrit poetry and prose.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        In this course, students will read some important sections from distinguished literary works. Past texts read include K\u0101lid\u0101sa\u2019s Raghuva\u1e43\u015ba, Bhart\u1e5bhari\u2019s N\u012bti\u015bataka, and \u015aa\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya's commentary on the \u012a\u015bopani\u1e63ad. In Winter 2025, we will read an important section (selected verses from III.55-62) from the V\u0101lm\u012bki-R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a (VR\u0101m.) as well as a section from the commentary (bh\u0101\u1e63ya) of \u015aabara on the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101-s\u016btra I.1.5 (in light of the B\u1e5bhat\u012b of Prabh\u0101kara). The former will enable students to understand how the close study of Sanskrit texts in their original enables one to conduct a literary analysis of a poetic work such as the VR\u0101m. The latter is a philosophical piece defending a position of ontological realism against an idealist argument (commonly referred to as the \"dreaming argument\") and the study of this will introduce students to the Sanskritic genre of (philosophical) \u015b\u0101stra.\u00a0In their previous study, students have been introduced to the importance of Sanskrit commentaries and they will refer to requisite commentaries in this course. Students will also be introduced to the styles, meters and peculiar syntactical forms found in such Sanskrit literary texts. This course seeks also to reinforce another important aim \u2013 to contrast some English translations of these influential works with the original Sanskrit text, thereby demonstrating to students the inevitable gap in any work of translation (and the consequent intellectual joy in being able to read the original!).",

        "description": "Theatre has evolved through time as an important tool of expression and communication.  It is not only a source of entertainment but can serve as a catalyst for social reform or development. Theatre also expands our connection to the larger world around us, and our empathy for lives lived differently from our own. A director or an actor thinks from the perspective of the diverse characters they portray, improving tolerance towards others in the society. The audience, in turn, becomes witness to worlds that they might otherwise not encounter or be familiar with. Studies have also shown that students who participate in theatre perform better in academics as it enhances their power to express themselves.This course aims to introduce students to the different forms and functions of theatre, inclusive of the wide range of roles theatre practitioners can take on, such as directing, acting and scriptwriting.  We will also simultaneously discuss how theatre relates to societal concerns, using theatre games to help students to find present day issues that are relevant to them. Importantly, we will work together on producing skits and script writing in peer groups to encourage students to work cohesively in groups, overcome their inhibitions and find the confidence to engage in creative self-expression.This course is at beginner level & doesn\u2019t require prior theatre experience. It is open to all students at the University. It will run for  one session a week (for 3 hours) as in a lab course.\u00a0It is offered by Kabir Thakore, the Director of the Scrapyard Theatre in Ahmedabad.",

        "description": "This course delves into the formation of the modern Hindi imagination through the influential works of Premchand, one of the most significant writers in Hindi and Urdu literature. His writings shaped the literary landscape of the Hindi-Urdu-speaking world and encapsulated the evolving hopes, struggles, and social consciousness of his time. By engaging with his works, students will explore how Premchand's storytelling contributed to the broader cultural and intellectual fabric of Hindi-speaking society.The course will approach Premchand's literature through two critical frameworks. The first will contextualize his work within the historical backdrop of the Indian national movement, with a particular emphasis on Gandhi's Hindustani ideals and the socio-political currents of the time. The second framework will bring Premchand's reflections on pressing issues such as caste, class, gender, communalism, and nationalism into dialogue with contemporary debates, highlighting the enduring relevance of his literary contributions.Premchand's ability to straddle the worlds of both Hindi and Urdu literature makes him a vital figure for understanding the composite culture of North India. By examining his work, students will gain new perspectives on the historical roots of today's social issues and the role of literature in shaping collective imagination.",

        "description": "\u201cBelieving is seeing\u201d is the Apple catchphrase to introduce its Pro Display XDR on the website. Only when one scrolls down can they know the technical details and the design that are ultimately there to promise a high-end visual experience. Apple is only one of many examples where visual experiences occupy a central position in understanding the contemporary and how that informs one\u2019s relationship with history and the past. These instances demonstrate that visual experiences are powerful mediators in a modern world where the clinical faculty of human vision assumes one of the central sensory responses. Indeed, seeing shapes what one believes about the world around and the ideologies structuring belief systems.  \n\nThrough intensive hands-on analyses of selected themes and specific visual forms, this course will look into how visual arts shape modern South Asian experiences and craft one\u2019s understanding of their contemporary and their past. It will discuss how visual art forms encode social norms and practices and embody myriad ways of seeing. The pedagogy and class discussions will revolve around the following key issues: What are the objects and sites through which unfolding stories of visual forms may be tracked? Why are artistic practices integral to addressing imperial, colonial, and postcolonial experiences? How do art forms forge community identities in the region, and what are their political implications? Do visual arts practices in modern South Asia belong to a fixed geographical and cultural landscape? Or does thinking about them entail thinking about shifting geopolitical and cultural boundaries? \n\nThese concerns will be addressed by closely experiencing specific media and material objects and their layered narratives. Students will have the opportunity of studying images and objects closely in museum and gallery spaces and appreciate their material, texture, colour and scale, which are often lost in digital projections in the classroom. Simultaneously, the course will weave together abstract thinking with historically and anthropologically grounded scholarship to train students not to see visual arts as na\u00efve forms; students will learn to analyse formal structures and social histories and how visual imageries structure one\u2019s historical consciousness.",

It specifically uses ethnographies \u2013 records, monographs, accounts of people, their culture or society based on extended fieldwork \u2013 to engage with religion as a category for analysis. Rather than an overview of multiple religions, the course is interested in exploring questions and ideas around power and practice, and engagements with and beyond the human.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \nThe course revolves around major themes that illustrate the study of religion: tradition, myth, ritual, priesthood, self and other, rationality, symbols, secularism, and modernity. It will inform students how religion structures society and disciplines selves. The course will challenge preconceived notions of religion and introduce students to critically examine embodied and ensouled systems.\nSessions will be divided into two components: one will focus on theoretical approaches, concepts, and trends; while the other will attend to select ethnographies and orient students towards field approaches. Readings will be a mix of classics, contemporary debates, short films, and ethnographies. Students will be introduced to reading ethnographies, collecting field data, and writing ethnographic notes.\u00a0\nThe course is valuable to students across the disciplines of History, Philosophy, Psychology, and Social and Political Sciences. It will also help students prepare for their Undergraduate thesis.",

        "description": "Street theatre is a form of performing art that takes place in public spaces, such as streets, parks, or squares. It often involves theatrical performances that address social or political issues, using creative and interactive techniques to engage with the audience. Street theatre is theatre which goes to the people and performed among them, and has potential to create significant awareness about critical issues of society.\nThe aim of this course is to make aware students about social issues around them that need to be addressed, and present it in a creative and effective way in front of concerned group of people. Students - often described as engine of change for any society - will learn to produce their street theatre performances while also understanding its legacy through the history of art. The course will also make student aware and conscious of the society and environment they live in, while also focussing on important and relevant socio-political issues that affect them.",

More specifically, students interested in theatre, literature, designing and parallel creative fields, would benefit. The course falls at the intersection of theatre and designing. Scenic design would teach scene design specific to theatre. The course has been structured to have a holistic approach to the idea of creation and design. Focus would remain heavy on learning the \u2018process\u2019 that one must go through to create; building a base, a backstory, researching, rejecting and revisiting during the process of ideation.Following is the breakdown of how the course is structured: - Movement and composition in acting - Acting and Space design - Creating images from text - Light design - Set design - Sound and music - 3D mapping as new technology - Design principles in scenography - Types of theatres and theatre architecture",

The course attempts to dwell on both parts, as the latter is important in initiating, and refining the other part. The course will start from explaining what is research, the several steps involved in doing scientific research starting from identification of a problem, question, or hypothesis, reviewing the existing literature to rationalize the problem, selection of methods to investigate the question, collecting data, interpreting data using quantitative analyses and reporting findings. Each step will be accompanied by demo data sets and case studies, to provide doctoral students a flavor of designing and conducting research.",

Students have been introduced to the intricacies of Persian morphology and syntax in PER101 and PER102 and were introduced to Persian prose and poetry in PER201. This course allows them to continue with their study of scholastic Persian texts.In this course, we will read some famous episodes from two influential texts - the Gulist\u0101n (\u202b\u06af\u0644\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u202c\u200e) of Sa\u02bfd\u012b, as well as a collection of\u00a0\u0121azals (\u063a\u0632\u0644) of Chandar Bhan Brahman from the \u0120azaliyat-e-Brahman (originally from his Chah\u0101r Chaman and Munsha\u2019\u0101t-i Brahman).The Gulist\u0101n (\u202b\u06af\u0644\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u202c\u200e) of Sa\u02bfd\u012b (1210-1292 CE) is a landmark of Persian literature, perhaps its single most influential work of prose. Written in 1258 CE, it is one of two major works of the Persian poet Sa'di, considered one of the greatest medieval Persian poets. Students have already studied some stories (\u062d\u06a9\u0627\u06cc\u062a) from this work during PER201 and will continue their study of this work also during PER202.Students will also be introduced during this course to the works of the great Indian Persian poet and prose stylist, Chander Bhan Brahman (d. ca. 1666\u201370). Chander Bhan was a Mughal poet and state secretary (munsh\u012b), and scholars consider him to have belonged to a high-caste Brahmin family, educated primarily in Sanskrit. Yet, this influential intellectual spent the bulk of his career in elite positions at the courts of Jahangir (r. 1605\u201328), Shah Jahan (r. 1628\u201358) and even possibly Aurangzeb \u2018Alamgir (r. 1658\u20131707). His Persian writings thus contain much of immense value and enable students to study \"Indian\" Persian.Students will also be asked to consider some translations of these works and compare them to the original Persian text, understanding thereby the inevitable gap in any work of translation (and the intellectual joy therefore in being able to read the original!).",

        "description": "Acting for stage and screen is a practice-based in-studio course which has been designed as a 4.5 credit 200-level elective course in the Performing Arts Pathway. It is open to all students interested in a hands-on training in the art and craft of acting. This course aims to introduce the basic skills required to be an actor on stage and screen. The art of acting can be approached from many different angles and there are several established methods available to pursue a character. This course is conceptually built around two main approaches of acting techniques established by two Soviet theatre artists, Stanislavski and his pupil Michael Chekhov. Physical techniques to find a character is a method of training developed by Konstantin Stanislavski and psychological gestures to find a character is a concept designed and used by Michael Chekhov. The course would allow the students to familiarize themselves with these two methods, considered the most effective in training actors for both theatre and cinema.\u00a0 This course consists of a combination of acting workshops focused upon movement, action, emotions and speech training, along with rehearsals, contextual studies and filmed and live performances.",

This area of study \u2013 Structural Biology - is fundamental to several areas in biology like biochemistry, molecular biology, and biophysics, and bears applications in fields like drug design, enzymology, and biotechnology. The course is divided into four parts: 1. From Sequence to Structure, 2. From Structure to Function, 3. Control of Protein Function. These three parts systematically explore how protein structure determines biological function. Part 4, addresses how one may deduce function when structure is not available, introducing the concepts and the power of computational methods to predict structure, which enables addressing its function. Students will learn about the hierarchical organization of proteins, the forces driving protein folding, and obtain an overview of techniques for determining protein structures. The course emphasizes the dynamic nature of proteins, covering topics like enzyme catalysis, allosteric regulation, and protein-protein interactions from a structural point of view. Additionally, it addresses the role of (misfolded/compromised) proteins in diseases and explores protein engineering and drug design. Through lectures, case studies, and flipped classes, students will gain a comprehensive understanding of how proteins operate at the atomic level and how structural insights can be applied in biotechnology and medicine.",

We cover Monte Carlo approximations and show that Monte Carlo approximations in higher dimensions lead to more effective estimations. Finally, we introduce sophisticated approaches as Metropolis Hastings algorithm, Markov Chain Monte Carlo approximations for estimating the statistical quantities. A simple illustration is to use MCMC approaches for evaluating option pricing, portfolio optimization, tail risk etc.",

This course provides an opportunity to explore the real-world behavior of light through experiments that complement the theory of Oscillations, Waves, and Optics. Students shall learn about wave propagation in different media, geometrical optics, diffraction, interference, polariser and polarisation of light, etc., through hands-on experiments. In several cases, students will design and assemble instruments or set up experiments to demonstrate an optics concept. The course emphasizes on error analysis, measuring sensitivity of instruments, scientific documentation, and communication of results through oral presentation and viva.",

While often viewed through the lens of contemporary geopolitics, and the urgency of 'now,' this conflict has deep historical roots that stretch back to the 19th century. The conflict is shaped by the remnants of European colonial empires, colonialism, nationalism, religious identity, and competing historical narratives.This course examines the Israel-Palestinian conflict by eschewing the 'now' and\u00a0tracing the evolution of the conflict from the decline of the Ottoman Empire through British Mandate Palestine, the creation of the State of Israel, regional wars, shifting alliances, and ongoing occupation and resistance. Special attention will be paid to the changing nature of the conflict: from one primarily between Israel and Arab states to its current manifestation as a struggle between Israel and Palestinians. We will also examine the broader regional and global contexts that have influenced its trajectory, and reflect on the influence of the Israel-Palestinian conflict on politics outside of the Middle East.\u00a0Students will engage critically with the complex causes, developments, and consequences of this conflict via extensive examination of primary sources. The course aims to equip students with the tools to analyse how history is written, remembered, and contested in one of the world\u2019s most enduring and polarising struggles.",

This course is a study of the classical debates between Buddhists who denied the existence of any core, essence, abiding subject, or willing self, and hence are called No-Selfists (nair\u0101tmyavadin-s), and orthodox Ny\u0101ya philosophers, as well as Kashmir \u015aaiva philosophers who agreed with much of Buddhist epistemology but rejected their No-Selfism. The inquiry will start with a discussion of the meaning of \u201cself\u201d, before we come to the metaphysical meaning of \"\u0101tman\", as the core, substantial essence of anything.

        "description": "The creation and experience of art and beauty appear to be among the most distinctively human capacities. While we are happy with AI solving complicated mathematical problems and collating large swathes of data, a sense of disquiet descends when we encounter AI-generated art. What underlies this discomfort? What is art, and what is beauty? Is there an inevitable connection between the two? Is the aesthetic experience sui generis? And, are the categories of Art and Aesthetics universal?\nThis course explores these and related questions by drawing upon Indic thought (mainly Alank\u0101ra\u015b\u0101stra) and Western Philosophy (mainly of the Empiricist/Language Analysis tradition). The sessions will be anchored in readings of both primary and secondary sources, enabling reflective engagement with key questions, debates, and theoretical frameworks concerning art and beauty. These explorations will address their interconnections with emotion, form, expression, taste, and value, including twentieth-century non-essentialist perspectives that challenge the very possibility of a unified theory of art.",

        "description": "Art, Material and Media is a course open for students interested in the creative process of art-making who would like to develop an understanding about the layered process of art-making and artistic inquiry.This practice-based course explores the creative process and the intimate relationship between materials and mediums of art through an exploration of four significant and interwoven concepts -- object, subject, space and temporality.  The course will unpack these four conceptual categories through various practical and theoretical entry-points and demonstrate how they are integrated in order to produce meaningful and coherent works of art.Students will delve into a guided dissection of the process of art-making with a sharp focus on how materials and mediums are chosen, perceived and assembled to create a work of art. This understanding will be developed through an exposure to various forms of art-making and their processes. This will be explored hands-on through practice-based projects developed by students across this course.",

There should be some factors determining the number of genes to turn on and off depending on whether it\u2019s a liver cell or the skin cell. Few sets of genes are turned on and off in making a liver cell a liver cell and a skin cell a skin cell and this is known as epigenome.

The course begins with Semiconductor Fundamentals, Energy Band Diagrams, Carrier Mobility and Scattering, Carrier Distribution, Equilibrium Carrier Concentration, and Continuity Equation. These concepts are applied to PN Junction Diode to discuss PN Junction Electrostatics, Ideal I-V Characteristics, and Deviation from Ideal Characteristics. The course extends the understanding of the PN junction diode to Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJT) and covers BJT Static Characteristics, Ideal Transistor Analysis and Deviation from Ideal Characteristics. The Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) structure is studied with the focus on MOS Capacitor Energy Band Diagrams, Electrostatics, Major Regions of Operation, and Non-idealities in MOS structure. The learning is then extended to MOS Field Effect Transistor (MOSFET) to study qualitative theory of MOSFET Operation, Derivation of ideal I-V Characteristics, Deviation from ideal characteristics and Introduction to the\u00a0 MOSFET Scaling. Selected Modern Aspects of MOSFET are covered towards the end of the course.",

A basic understanding of utilizing software, which includes Grammarly and Turnitin, will also be introduced for effective writing and removing general and AI text similarities. At the end of Track 1, participants will identify a research direction (based on their interest) and shortlist papers based on the lessons learned. In addition, Track 1 will also investigate the understanding and writing/editing of a technical manual.Track 2 introduces tools and techniques for easy manuscript development and collaborative writing. In particular, Track 2 introduces LaTeX, Gnuplot, and various technical drawing tools (primarily open source tools) for idea development, productive technical writing, and presentation without consuming more time for placement of figures and tables, writing mathematical equations, generating bibliographies, and generating vectorized figures.Track 3 develops the basics of effective technical presentations, making presentations (LaTeX is preferred), slide organization, content design of a slide, delivering talks, highlighting takeaways, ending a presentation, and attending questions from the audience; one technical seminar to be delivered during the Track 3 activity.Track 4 is a group activity where a group of participants (based on the class strength) will be given a topic of their technical area of interest (where they want to pursue research). The participants need to write a survey based on the selected research papers. Track 4 activity will be scattered throughout the course duration.",

It provides students with the tools to understand how infections spread, how interventions influence epidemic trends, and how models can help with public health decisions. Starting with the basics of transmission dynamics, students will learn how to create, analyze, and simulate compartmental models like the SI, SIS, and SIR frameworks. More complex topics will be introduced, including diseases with long incubation periods, vector-borne transmission, and models with seasonality, using case studies of diseases such as tuberculosis, measles, dengue, influenza, COVID-19, and HIV. \n\nA key focus is on the reproduction number, force of infection, and epidemic thresholds, along with methods for estimating these figures from data. The course highlights model building as a process that consists of: (a) turning biological questions into mathematical frameworks, (b) examining model behavior, (c) calibrating against real-world data, and (d) evaluating the effects of interventions like vaccination, quarantine, or vector control.\n\nStudents will gain practical experience through R-based sessions that include simulation, model fitting, and inference. By the end of the course, participants will be able to critically assess infectious disease models in scientific literature and create comprehensive models to address research and policy questions.",
