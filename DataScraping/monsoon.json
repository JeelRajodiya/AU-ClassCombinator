To a trained professional it gives a substantial insight into where a company may be headed in the future. However, to an untrained eye the annual report may seem like walls of accounting technicalities provided to fill space between the glossy photos and the upbeat messages from the CEO. In many aspects, reading an annual report could be a daunting task as it is a mixture of factual financial results and public relation information. There is a wide communication gap between the world of compliance and disclosure. It is difficult to interpret and understand the information provided in slick expensively produced annual reports. There can be no better piece of information about a company than annual reports but it is essential to cut through the marketing clutter in annual reports and extract vital information (financial content) that shows true picture of the company.",

		"Description": "'Business-model' is a buzz word now in boardrooms, especially when the business encounters problems. The managers agree or disagree if the present business model is working any more or it needs navigation. To put it simply, a business model is both a short- and long-term framework of plans and moral rules within which a business operates. If the business model is strong it creates value and business prospers. Reverse happens when the business model is week. Over a period of time, an existing business calibrates its business model in keeping with the surrounding changes to remain relevant otherwise it may perish. A carefully designed business model has an inherent strength but it may not be long lasting. Hence, calibration is necessary from time to time. A rightly calibrated business model can act as a game changer. Today\u2019s business models were imagined a decade ago and we have to create tomorrow\u2019s business model considering many unknown bets.  Therefore, formal education and intelligent hard work are necessary to create a winning business model. Even though there are some generic and popular business models developed by experts, the owners and managers can bypass the standard ones and create a differentiated business model most suited to their businesses. This course mainly deals with identifying and placing various business drivers in sequence and changing it whenever and wherever necessary in order to make competitive business models.\u00a0,",

Students will be guided to prototype solutions that bridge their primary field of study with the Humanities. The course will result in the culmination of a final project answering a research question which is designed in conjunction with the software development life cycle. Students will also engage closely in a project with Navjivan Press to aid them in their digitisation efforts and experience first-hand the entire process of data analysis, OCR, the utility of unicode for our vernacular languages. The tools that will primarily be used are Python, JupyterNotebook, the command line; use of other OpenAccess methods will be encouraged. Students need not have any prior knowledge of these tools to register for this course. The coursework would broadly involve the creation of born-digital works, critical analysis essays, network analyses on large corpus of humanities data, data visualization and presentations. Students would work individually and in groups, following best practices.,",

The study of the concepts and techniques of environmental valuation would be important. Topics covered would include those related to development and sustainability: the degree of substitutability between natural resources and produced forms of capital (namely physical and human) and limits to growth implied by it. Since economic growth of developing nations often involves rising pollution, the course would also spend some time on discussing the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC). The course concludes with \u201cgreening\u201d the system of national accounts and attempts to include value of environmental services within the national product of countries (including the case for India).

Furthermore, the need for professionals to manage health care facilities will also grow. Overall, healthcare management involves the administration of hospitals and hospital networks, medical facilities and oversight of health care professionals. To be a vital part of the medical industry, the role of a health care manager does not require direct care to patients. Presently, there is a lack of managerial understanding, in addition to the belief of the holistic nature of quality management to attain an improved standard of patient care.

		"Description": "This course is an introduction to the basic concepts and standards underlying the financial accounting systems. It aims to build upon the important accounting concepts and principles including revenue recognition, inventory, depreciation, and understanding the accounting equation. The course focuses initially on how to record economic events in the accounting records (i.e., bookkeeping and accrual accounting) and how to prepare and interpret the primary financial statements that summarize a firm's economic transactions (i.e., the balance sheet, the income statement, and the statement of cash flows). The course adopts a decision-maker perspective of accounting by emphasizing the relation between accounting data and the underlying economic events that generated them thereby enabling the students to read, understand and analyse financial statements through ratio analysis. The course also explores the areas of financial shenanigans wherein the students will be able to learn how companies use financial statements to disguise economic reality.,",

In this sense, organisations are not merely seen as a place where communication happens, but it exists because employees communicate and create the sense in the existing structure. Also, the idea of the workplace has moved beyond the simple \"office space\" to \"living social networks\" that combine work, home and play. Moreover, organisations use their website and social media to communicate with internal and external stakeholders. Viewed, thus, in this context, the course looks at the constitutive view of communication and intends to familiarise students with workplace communications as practised in the corporate world. The course is interdisciplinary and involves the combination of concepts (communication, sociology and computer-mediated technology) into one project. ,",

This course is primarily about creating visual artefacts that communicate effectively, but that does not mean you need to be an artist to succeed. Assessment will focus upon your efforts and your willingness to engage with your classmates to provide feedback and learn from one another. The more time you spend with the exercises in this course, the more skills you will develop as a visual communicator. Take the time to explore each exercise, take risks, and reiterate often. Don\u2019t allow your first attempt at any solution to be your only attempt. Fail early and fail often. Learning what doesn\u2019t work is an essential process in understanding what does work.

		"Description": "The city of Ahmedabad has been at the crossroads of major historical currents. A key commercial centre of western India, Ahmedabad was at the vanguard of industrialisation in modern India. Ahmedabad via the coastal port cities such as Surat was a gateway to the sea routes of the Indian Ocean via the Arabian Sea, home to influences from West Asia as well as peninsular South Asia. Although the city functioned as a political and administrative centre, it had a strong tradition of craft goods production, merchant entrepreneurship, and banking and financial services.\u00a0 It maintained thriving trade contacts with\u00a0 neighbouring towns and port cities as well as imperial centres at Delhi and Agra. In 1700 AD, Ahmedabad was, by some estimates, the sixth most populous city in the world[1]. Today, it continues as one of the most populous cities in India, a key node of national politics as well as business and urban development initiatives and emblematic of the opportunities and challenges before contemporary Indian society, wherein modernist development paradigms have been superimposed on traditional social structures.\u00a0The course will help students understand the city as an arena for economic activities (industry, trade and commerce, and informal work), merchant communities, entrepreneurship, city life and culture, and global engagement over the centuries. It will also examine the causes and consequences of conflicts over material and symbolic resources, which have been key to the social organisation of the city. It examines various efforts at urban development charting the city\u2019s built form for the future. Through a combination of lectures, classroom discussions, and projects the course encourages students to analyse these historical and contemporary processes in Ahmedabad in the wider historical context of Gujarat. Through these experiences, students will receive an introduction to disciplinary concepts and theories that will be built upon systematically by later courses in the student\u2019s chosen major.\u2018Ahmedabad as a Gateway to the World\u2019 is a mandatory course for all BA students majoring in History or SPS (Social and Political Sciences), and for all Integrated MBA students.

Exercises (sentences, verses and passages) for each class will be drawn from original Sanskrit works (brief description below), and will be chosen so as to exemplify the key grammatical features which need to be explained.            The Pa\u00f1catantra is a famous collection of Sanskrit stories, in verse and prose, dated to around the second/third century CE and is considered a n\u012bti\u015b\u0101stra (a treatise on government or political science). The V\u0101lm\u012bki R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a is one of the two famous Indian epics, a mammoth work comprising nearly 24,000 verses and which is of monumental importance and legacy.  Each class will be divided into three segments: a revision of the past lesson(s) (and review of assigned after-class exercises), the scheduled lesson, and in-class exercises taken from Sanskrit literature. There will also be surprise tests to further reinforce the learning of various grammatical features.   This course will prepare students to take the second of this set of courses, wherein students will study more advanced syntactical aspects of the language. These two courses will prepare students with the adequate training in Sanskrit grammar to begin their study of original Sanskrit works.

Students who are taking a minor in philosophy may also use it to meet their philosophy credit requirements.In the course, we will engage in a close reading of one of the most influential philosophical texts of the 20th century, Thomas Kuhn\u2019s The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (SSR), originally published in 1962. Sessions will primarily consist in detailed reading and discussing the revolutionary importance of SSR, especially in our understanding of science. We will also supplement our reading of this book by looking at a selection of important articles which address some of the focal themes, concepts, and arguments of SSR. The course aims thereby to prepare students for advanced research in the humanities, while illustrating the dynamic processes through which classic philosophical texts are taken up and transform our understanding of a subject (in this case science) in philosophy and beyond.",

		"Description": "Psychologists empirically study mind and behaviour while philosophers (of mind) conceptually analyse and develop arguments about the nature of mind/behaviour. However, there is a cross-pollination between Philosophy and Psychology. Often, the insights developed by philosophers guide the empirical work of psychologists, and similarly, the empirical findings of psychologists have implications for philosophical/theoretical accounts of mind/behaviour. In this spirit, this course discusses the broad theoretical and philosophical implications of the findings of Psychology, particularly with respect to the psychological processes of consciousness, thinking, rationality, free will, and social minds. However, it should be clarified that this course is distinct from traditional \u201cPhilosophy of Mind\u201d courses which tend to focus on the fundamental nature of the mind; this course focuses on the empirical findings in Psychology and their theoretical (or philosophical) implications. The sample of the theoretical/philosophical implications of the empirical findings of Psychology include: (a) Do limited resource models of attention imply that we do not see everything that we could see? (b) Do we need language to think? (c) Do we possess the processes to acquire accurate knowledge about ourselves? (d) Why aren\u2019t we always rational? and (e) Do we have free will?\u00a0,",

In this course, an attempt will be made to read Premchand's literature in two layers. The first layer of reading will bring together Premchand's historical context, the period of the Indian national movement, and Gandhi's Hindustani movement. The second layer of readings will connect present-day issues like nationalism, communalism, caste, gender, and class, to Premchand's articulation of those questions. Premchand is equally a representative writer of both Hindi and Urdu languages. Getting acquainted with his literature in light of the Hindi-Urdu composite culture will give students a new perspective on understanding contemporary issues and their historical underpinnings.,",

Students will understand how ideas about what development means have changed over time, and be able to then examine for themselves how the culture and politics, especially of India, has changed accordingly.We will read how development has been researched qualitatively, through ethnographies (long-term case studies) of the targets of development interventions, and use such ground-up perspectives to evaluate the successes and failures of development holistically. The course will examine specific thrust areas of development such as gender equality, tribal upliftment, environmental protection in terms of their achievements and shortcomings. The course is distributed into four modules that will examine (a) anthropological approaches to development and the history of development; (b)critiques of development and its power; (c) local negotiations with development interventions, and (d) new concepts beyond development. The course will thus familiarize students with the theories and concepts that have emerged to voice the various discontents with developmentalist ideas and policies. \u00a0For any student planning to enter the development sector, be a benefactor, or simply an interested citizen, this course will give them the tools to engage with the phenomenon through a historical and critical lens.,",

While drawing is often seen as a primary tool supporting creative research within art practice, this course will also consider drawing as an independent and intimate approach that offers a keen insight to both the creative process and one\u2019s emotional state. To that end, it is a studio-practice course aided by strong contextual studies that will enable students to develop basic rendering skills, understand drawing as a form of action and gesture that is an affirmation of life. Students will be able to objectively perceive the world we live in, which forms the crux of art-making in any art form \u2013 including printmaking, photography, painting, and digital art.",
