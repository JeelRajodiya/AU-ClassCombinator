										<td><br><span>COM101 is the intermediate level of the University’s communication courses designed to promote linguistic and academic development. This course is about reading and comprehension as well as about creative and formal writing. It aims at training students to develop strategies in reading for understanding, drawing inferences and analysing evidence, and general competence for writing formal essays. This course seeks to prepare students to communicate in English for success in their core courses and beyond graduation. The course uses literary pieces, academic articles, and audio-visual sources to develop comprehension, lateral and critical thinking, argumentative skills, and analytical ability that enable students to write well-researched essays while adhering to global standards of academic writing.</span><br><br>

While quantitative methodologies and the need for big data drive research in Management studies, this course demonstrates how far business history is a truly global field, even while studying it from a national framework. To draw in-depth, fine-grained comparisons across different regions of the country, examining strategies of firms, states, and business associations, students stand to gain new perspectives into their own businesses while participating in current debates in adjacent fields such as political economy and global businesses.  This course on the history of Indian Business is multidisciplinary in its nature, where history and business are conjointly examined as important tools for understanding human nature and its past endeavors, throwing light on the present and future in many ways for the young managers/entrepreneurs.  By following a project based learning pedagogy, this course attempts at enabling students to understand history as contemporary, everyday lived experience.  </span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>In an era of changing business scenarios, human resources have emerged as an inalienable part of the business. From merely being a medium of economic activity, human resources have emerged as an intrinsic stakeholder in the business. In a world of increasing regulatory requirements, efficient compliance of employment codes is the minimum that organizations must achieve. 

Premier organizations strive to strategize their human resource policies and man-power requirements in a way that not only ensures smooth compliance of employment laws but generates greater benefits for an internal stakeholder. 

This course discusses in detail the Labour Codes applicable in India. It starts by examining the constitutional aspects of labour laws. The course then moves on to discussing the four labour codes prevailing in India. In the concluding part, the course discusses the regulatory framework in different countries and highlights the role of global organizations like the International Labour Organization.</span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>This course deals with Leadership. In the present context the idea of Leadership is changing. A leader is no longer a person with authority who can guide a group of people to a defined goal. The course will highlight the understanding of leadership in the context of influence as suggested by John Maxwell. A modern leader is authentic, leads by example, encourages, empowers, and nurtures people around her /him. S/he is empathetic towards needs of others, is humble and emotionally intelligent. This course aims to enable participants understand and develop leadership insights and competencies at self, group and organisational levels. At the theoretical level, the course aims to provide conceptual frameworks to understand various aspects of leadership at the said three levels. It would highlight the seminal works of John Maxwell, Kouzes and Posner, Richard Daft, Bill George, James Scouller, Ken Blanchard, Jim Collins and Robert Greenleaf among others.   At the application level, the course aims to provide necessary knowledge and skills required to develop a Leadership repertoire in personal and professional contexts through reflections, experiential learning and classroom discussions.  The course would help participants to gain insights into Authentic Leadership and how one can become an effective leader by knowing one’s self and people around us.
																																					
														        
The course will help students to bring in changes at a personal level through reflections and introspection and will help them understand their own values, skills, goals, leadership purpose, leadership readiness etc.

										<td><br><span>In human history, the city has existed both as an idea and a place. Also, cities often develop around very different purposes. For instance, some cities become the space for national and international political activities, and some become the hub for business and trade. Other cities are primarily seen as sites for tourism and leisure. However, apart from these images, a city is also subject to continuous change—such as political, cultural, social and religious—which affect the lifestyle of city-dwellers and the image of a city from time to time. Viewed, thus, in the above perspective, City as Text course broadens the idea of a text as a landscape which includes cultural artifacts, institutions, and street cultures, socio-political and economic discourses. This course is interdisciplinary (provides economic perspective, cultural landscape analysis, political and social analysis, and historical background) and would mainly focus on urban formal and informal spaces such as commercial, residential and public. Learning processes in this course are characterized in three main ways:  •	Firstly, intellectual development – understanding the specific socio-economic, cultural, and political factors that have shaped the city and the integration of theoretical and practical concepts. The urban environment enables a variety of different modes of learning, including guided student discovery and interpretation. •	Secondly, technical development - students have the opportunity to hone observation and analytical skills, and competence in information processing and research, as they are brought into direct first-hand contact with the object of their investigation. And as an arena of encounter and interaction, the urban environment facilitates processes of personal development. •	Finally, with the help of digital humanities pedagogy, students will be able to study the intersection between technology and the human experience using the digital tool. This pedagogy will help students to learn the nuances of computing methods to do humanities research. </span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>This course offers an introduction to the study of investments in a portfolio context. In doing so, it exposes students to the breadth of investment alternatives and portfolio construction to meet certain investment objectives. Different individuals or institutions will have differing investment objectives. The course will start with a discussion of the ways in which objectives vary, and the resulting portfolio implications. After a brief review of the various markets and their structures we will turn to one of the cornerstones of modern finance - "Modern Portfolio Theory". This is an emphasis on the importance of constructing optimal portfolios, in which diversification is used to achieve a target objective. It holds that capital should be allocated among the major asset groups in order to arrive at a balance of risk and return that matches the circumstances and objectives of the investor. Only after this allocation does individual security selection come into play.We will then go to a review of asset pricing theory, with a brief stop at equity valuation, and bond mathematics. In doing so, students would be exposed to different methods of valuation namely DCF, Relative Valuation and Economic Value Added in the context of deriving the intrinsic value of a share. This is followed by an overview of equity and bond portfolio management strategies and a review of prevailing portfolio performance measures. The course concludes with the question of performance evaluation - how do we measure success as compared to the original objectives?While a predominant proportion of the course contents fall within the contours of "Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)", the course also acclimatizes students on the trajectory of discourse on market efficiency – EMH to Behavioral Finance to Adaptive Market Hypothesis (AMH).  </span><br><br>

														        Organisations are a combination of interactions, relationship and processes that are played out in various scenarios to make the organisation function efficiently. These interactions are not simple in nature and may lead to varied outcomes. Consequently, making an organization a system that is constantly evolving in terms of people, behaviour and its reaction to the systems. In the contemporary world, variables of data, technology, automation, shared economy, behaviour, people and interactions are the reason for any organisation to sustain and leap. Owing to ambidexterity in organisations and people, we see a drastic shift that organisations are going to work. The pandemic has acted as a catalyst for numerous changes in organisations. Thus, making it more critical and intricate to understand the interaction among people, behaviour and the organisations in which we work. The course will be an introduction to concepts that are going to be a part of students/ Managers organisational life. The students shall be able to test their understanding of the concepts that we introduce by examining Organisational life cycle and its various components. This will involve understanding, reflecting and looking at processes that are part of the organisational life of individuals, members of a team or organisations. We shall focus on the following:•    What is organisation for an individual?•    Based on my life and experiences, how do I look at the idea of organisation.•    As a manger/ Employee/ or entrepreneurs what will be my role in an organisation.The course is designed to introduce students to the ideas of Managing people in organisations. While going through the course, they will be able to understand, reflect, debate around the life of and life in organisations during the changing times. Each topic will be acting as the building blocks of organisations and life within them.</span><br><br>

It would equip the students to develop people skills and enable them to deal with issues such as improving productivity, job satisfaction, motivation, learning etc. in organisations. The course would promote self-awareness and interpersonal awareness and students’ ability to work in groups and in organizational settings.

										<td><br><span>This is a policy oriented course that aims to provide an overview of theoretical debates and empirical evidence on the urban informal economy. It emphasizes policy and programmatic responses to the informal economy. The informal (unorganized) economy contributes about 60 percent of GDP and employs about 92 percent of the workforce (including agriculture). Small enterprises and labour are struggling to remain afloat and competitive in the current context of globalization and the pandemic crisis. The course is designed to provide an understanding of the informal economy and its various segments. An exposure to the nature of difficulties faced in doing business by enterprises in the sector would help analyze available policy options. This year the course will focus on GIG workers and Digital Businesses and identify problems and find solutions to issues based on field work and secondary data. </span><br><br>

Professionals & organizations working or desiring to start a new venture in diverse fields require an understanding and insight of Project Management concepts and methods. Projects are vital and often businesses and various functions start with this management operation. Initial activities within a function also start with projects, for eg. Launching a new product in the market or implementing ERP within the organisation. The products are developed at lab scale, tried at pilot scale and produced at plant scale. To handle all these activities later in their careers, management students have to learn Project Management techniques and through planning and control techniques to execute projects. </span><br><br>

Design is a set of activities and processes to bring about this improvement and beneficial change on their own. Design Thinking is a set of activities and processes to let design happen on its own. It is aimed at making designerly behaviour a very core mindset and bodyset.Design Thinking in the modern context is recognised as a core business activity which is capable of enhancing all activities around it, making them better and more human and consequently profitable as well. Over the years, it has developed as a very robust and ever-evolving combination of design, science, human behaviour and business principles. At the centre of this is the target user for whom systems are built to understand them, empathise with them define their problems and help them solve these problems through strategically targeted design interventions. Ultimately, all business is about the people who invest in it through one or the other level of consumer behaviour. Design Thinking is aimed at giving business thinkers, a very deeply strategic advantage in the market.The proposed course is an introduction to Design Thinking which is delivered through a set of 14 sessions, discussions, and structured assignments that help internalise these basic concepts. Several minor assignments and a major project serve as a vehicle for participative action that is central to the understanding of Design Thinking as applied to imaginative business models while understanding four key aspects – context, intent, recipients of the design and the system involved.</span><br><br>

														        Human resource management is the process of gaining a competitive advantage through people. Organizational performance is driven by people, and it depends on certain measures. Human Resource (HR) experts need to be skilled at planning and interpreting organizations' people metrics. This requires a solid understanding of HR analytics, i.e., the systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of data considered to improve decisions about talent and moreover the organization at large. The application of analytics is changing the way HR managers quantify the value that people (i.e., talent) - a company’s biggest asset - have on the organization's ability to succeed in the market or in its mission. For enabling managers to make smart decisions about talent, HR needs to effectually leverage data. When equipped with metrics that are suitably designed and easy to interpret, HR can render managers with analytics to make decisions which will not only improve operations nonetheless also create systemic advantages. Data and sophisticated analysis are brought in the dynamics to effectively handle people-related issues viz., recruiting, hiring and promotion, performance evaluation, leadership, collaboration, job design, and compensation. The curriculum is of an introductory nature to the theory of people analytics. It is not intended to prepare learners to perform complex talent management data analysis. At the conclusion of this course, you will be able to understand that how and when hard data is operated to make soft-skill decisions about hiring and talent development; therefore, you may level yourself as a strategic partner in the company’s talent management decisions. The course will help students in three distinct ways. One, it will provide students with the latest grounding in current evidence on managing people, providing a knowledge base which shall ensure that their future management is led by the best practices. Second, develop the understanding and skills that are necessary to be thoughtful, critical consumers of data on people management, allowing them to make an in-depth analysis as they make people decisions. Third, provide direction and practice in conducting people analytics, preparing students to gather their own data, and making students more skilled analysts. These goals will be pursued through a mixture of case discussion, lecture, and hands-on exploration of a variety of data sets. The course is intended to introduce you to the fact that Organizations flourish when the people who work in them flourish. Analytics can help make both happen.</span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>Heritage is a broad concept that draws from various disciplinary discourses including anthropology, architecture, art, culture, development, ecology, environment, forestry, geography, history, natural resources, traditional arts and crafts, urban design and planning, wildlife and so on. However, a general perception of heritage usually refers only to the historic and monumental examples of heritage. Even within the monument-centric discourse, it is widely perceived that the objective of heritage conservation and management is to ‘preserve’ heritage as it is (the cult of the ruins) by using conservation and preservation as a technical process of ensuring the longevity of the ruins. However, it is widely accepted and followed today that the heritage discourse has evolved much broadly to account for change and continuity, the intangibles and more recently calls have been made to view heritage holistically. As opposed to the conservation / preservation paradigm, an interdisciplinary management paradigm is evolving through discourses as well as frameworks of practice at different levels. 
																																					
														        This course provides an overview of both the conventional notions and the evolving concepts. Hence, it gives a critical foundation to heritage understanding and makes students aware of a range of global frameworks that have been influencing current heritage practices. 
This will be a foundational course to begin both for Masters as well as Doctoral students in heritage management. </span><br><br>

It is also important for individuals who create any original work, be it in the scientific, literary, or cultural domain. Intellectual property rights are considered monopolistic rights, but the monopoly is a limited one as the IPRs will go in the public domain after a certain stipulated time. The ethical implications of the IPRs will be discussed and deliberated during the course through various case studies where monopolistic presence versus the social benefits are in conflict especially pharmaceutical products and/or utilitarian goods. The course will familiarize students with the popular types of intellectual properties and the legal provisions related to them and the administrative remedies which can be sought for. With the advent of technology, intellectual property protection has become a challenge due to piracy. The course deals with the technological solutions to the sustainable inventions and whether they can be protected through IPRs or not he course also looks into the contemporary issues of Intellectual Property rights in the global context.

														        The area of behaviour is no more restricted solely to experimentation and to decode behaviour for work output. In these contemporary times, managers are challenging the accepted results of a traditional understanding of behaviours. The idea of how behaviour contributes at business, society, and technology levels is changing. The idea of behaviour lab is to deliver behaviour to look at businesses, areas, and domains affected by it. Addictive behaviour, Networks, Irrational decisions, Mapping behaviour online are the newer areas where behaviour’s application has become more relevant. This also means developing skills to understand, analyse and apply behaviour in other areas that are not just restricted to Businesses. Thus, learning behaviour with a more interdisciplinary focus and having skills to understand and analyse them. Consequently, such skills facilitate a person to survive what waits for them in the professional world. Workplace challenges, often fuelled by a keen intuition, can now form the basis of experiments that allow us to understand the processes, decisions, communities and how they work in tandem to achieve or/ and survive changes. Behaviour Lab equips students with tools, methods and interventions aligned with these changes and also help them later in their journey in the business world. Moreover, the course makes them aware of how the behaviour domain is contributing in areas that were untouched earlier.</span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), inaugurated in a summer workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956, has seen many ups and downs. After two short-lived booms in the early eighties and the late nineties, AI has come into its own in the last decade, partly because data-driven machine learning has tackled a wider range of problems than earlier approaches based on search, logic, and (human) expert knowledge. After a brief introduction to other areas of AI – game-playing, symbolic reasoning, knowledge representation, and planning – our course will focus mostly on machine learning. Together, machine learning and traditional statistics constitute data science, with everyday uses such as e-mail spam filtering and handwriting recognition and business applications such as credit rating, bankruptcy prediction, customer churn modelling, and employee turnover analysis. Today’s business graduates must learn about these applications of AI (particularly machine learning) to remain competitive in the field of management. AI also attracts significant investment in the financial markets. Hence, a good understanding of the field is critical to making smart investments in information technology.</span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>Does university policy on minimum class attendance improve student performance? Does girl education increase their marriage age and reduce fertility? Do new bank branches in villages increase women's entrepreneurship? Does a petrol price hike reduce private transportation usage? 

Such cause-and-effect questions on “Does X cause Y, or is X just correlated with Y?” are very relevant and come up in discussions in our day-to-day lives. However, the appropriate answer to such questions is very policy-relevant. Therefore, it requires a good understanding of the difference between correlation and causality and the methods that help differentiate between the two ideas. This course is essentially about learning how to find appropriate answers to the above questions.

In this course, students will learn the counterfactual model of causality, enabling them to identify the causal mechanisms that influence the relationship between two variables. For most of the course, students will receive an intuitive and theoretical understanding of the applied (microeconometric) research methods, followed by their applications through research papers and their practice in STATA. At the end of this course, students should be able to apply these methods to their research ideas and the corresponding data from any particular field of interest (development, education, health, labour, environment, finance, management, etc.).</span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>Of late, ‘Business Valuation’ has gained tremendous prominence due to various judicial pronouncements in India and abroad. In India, a new professional discipline on Valuation has been created through 2017-Valuation Rules and by setting up of Registered Valuers Organisations (RVO) for all purpose valuation. By its nature, valuation is not a precise science due to imperfections in the market and varying perceptions. A valuer may have perfect knowledge of the market but the market may not have perfect knowledge of the value. On every occasion there may not be a definitive value conclusion, but every valuation exercise is based on its circumstances and premise. There is nothing called correct valuation; valuation is an opinion and therefore, the principle of caveat applies. Valuation exercise needs methodical & logical approaches, careful application of the basic valuation principles and adherence to standards and practices. Therefore, a valuation professional needs to be better educated in order to make business valuation theories & practices better explained and better defined in the context. This course deals with various methods and techniques (comprising all the three internationally accepted approaches) of valuation to suit various purposes of valuation, following valuation standards, principles and regulations of the country. Emphasis is given on practical application of the concepts. </span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>An annual report is a powerful and revealing document about a company’s financial standing. To a trained professional it gives a substantial insight into where a company may be headed in the future. However, to an untrained eye the annual report may seem like walls of accounting technicalities provided to fill space between the glossy photos and the upbeat messages from the CEO. In many aspects, reading an annual report could be a daunting task as it is a mixture of factual financial results and public relation information. There is a wide communication gap between the world of compliance and disclosure. It is difficult to interpret and understand the information provided in slick expensively produced annual reports. There can be no better piece of information about a company than annual reports but it is essential to cut through the marketing clutter in annual reports and extract vital information (financial content) that shows true picture of the company.
																																					
														        This enable course will take the students through an intellectual tour of an annual report of the companies. It is designed and meant to develop skills to translate and read between the lines of the published financial statements and Notes to Accounts. It enhances the skill to sense the bigger picture behind the reporting of a company. The part of the course covers tools of financial analysis, including methods of evaluating accounting quality and corporate performance. The course shall address multiple issues pertaining to components of the Annual report like Management Discussion and Analysis (MDA), Directors Report (DR), Financial Highlights and Corporate Governance of the Companies. Through real world examples of listed/unlisted companies and projects, the course focuses on reading the annual reports with the thorough understanding of all the components essential for understanding the working of the company, its peers, economic environment, marketing aspects, growth trajectory, vision and analysis of the management, Auditors’ Remarks and the human resource and ethics as a part of corporate Governance. Students will learn to make better use of annual reports focusing on key issues, raising pertinent questions, and enhancing their understanding of the overall profile of the companies they are assessing.

																In an attempt to acquire a competitive advantage and maximise profit, companies seek ways to enhance customer loyalty.
																																					
														        The most powerful tool to this end is the model of designing experiences. ‘Experience’, differentiated from ‘service’, is a personal, particularly strong connection, based on emotions and imprinted in memory, that the company develops with its customers. 
It is important to note that the model has proved successful even at periods of instability/crisis.
The course presents the principles, methodologies and practical tools of the experience model, and applies it to a wide range of heritage organisations and sectors (such as cultural tourism, fashion/design/ traditional crafts, cultural events, educational programs and digital technology applications) with respect to heritage significance and values.
In this context, the key challenges for heritage organisations are to incorporate the experience model in their:
• strategy: customer experiences at the core of the business model, and not as an incidental byproduct
• management: setting in place and linking management levels, people, and processes for the designing and offering of experiences
• branding and marketing: creating a strong brand centred on customer experience; and communicating the offering of experiences to the customers, through various advertising channels. 
A wide range of heritage organisations, international and Asian and Indian ones, are used as case studies.
The ultimate aim of the course is to help current and potential managers design unique customised experiences, sustaining and expanding their organisations’ customer base and increasing customer loyalty.
The course is open to students of diverse backgrounds and interests. 
The course is offered to both postgraduate and undergraduate students.

										<td><br><span>'Business-model' is a buzz word now in boardrooms, especially when the business encounters problems. The managers agree or disagree if the present business model is working any more or it needs navigation. To put it simply, a business model is both a short- and long-term framework of plans and moral rules within which a business operates. If the business model is strong it creates value and business prospers. Reverse happens when the business model is week. Over a period of time, an existing business calibrates its business model in keeping with the surrounding changes to remain relevant otherwise it may perish. A carefully designed business model has an inherent strength but it may not be long lasting. Hence, calibration is necessary from time to time. A rightly calibrated business model can act as a game changer. Today’s business models were imagined a decade ago and we have to create tomorrow’s business model considering many unknown bets.  Therefore, formal education and intelligent hard work are necessary to create a winning business model. Even though there are some generic and popular business models developed by experts, the owners and managers can bypass the standard ones and create a differentiated business model most suited to their businesses. This course mainly deals with identifying and placing various business drivers in sequence and changing it whenever and wherever necessary in order to make competitive business models. </span><br><br>

Further, students would be introduced to different drivers of firm value. In doing so, students would be exposed to aspects such as capital budgeting, capital structure and working capital management. While the course per se would help the student navigate the different strands of financial management both at an individual level as well as at the firm level, such navigations are not only meant to build competency in individual strands, but also to help students attain an integrated perspective -one that is anchored on value creation.</span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>Brands exist in the consumers’ minds and yet entice them to act as if it were a relationship of the heart.Brands often look for top-of-mind recall, but branding is an emotional connection that the audience forms with the brand and its message thereby creating a loyal following. It is not what you think and says but what they (the audience) perceive and believe. Therefore, branding is a function of strategy and psychology that embeds various facets of design in it.This course is designed to cover the fundamentals of branding and packaging to sensitize you to the decision-making process required to create a cohesive brand language. In a world dominated by brands, it is important to understand the key differentiating factor and then build an experience around it.

There are many examples of good designs which have been inspired by nature. Biomimicry is studying elements from nature: form, colour, function, movement, life cycle, growth, etc. and using it as an inspiration for designing products, spaces, visuals for communication, systems, etc.Today in our modern world and our way of life, we are moving away from our natural connection with nature. It is all the more critical that we study its various inspects to learn and use it as an inspiration for good design. The whole area of Biomimicry, Bionics, etc, has developed a lot and there is a lot more awareness about this field in current times. Toys are also recognized today as playing an important role in learning, development, building cultural connect and socio-emotional bonds and as part of the entertainment sector. Toys are a part of unstructured play and a means to create playful experiences.  In this course, we will study nature with a new perspective and explore possibilities of using it to ideate and design toys or playful elements.</span><br><br>

So, why do so many products and services fail to achieve this ideal? All products, whether digital or otherwise, must deliver a high-quality user experience or risk losing users to competitors.The focus of interaction design is on user-centred design based on the understanding of real users including their experiences, goals, needs, wants and tasks. The goal of interaction design is also to collect and analyse data to make informed interface design decisions which are critical to creating and delivering successful products, services and systems that fulfil the user/customer, technological and business needs. </span><br><br>

An organization with a project culture is one that knows where it is going, is focused on results and has a professional team who knows what is expected of them. Professionals & organizations working or desiring to start a new venture in diverse fields require an understanding and insight of Project Management concepts and methods. Projects are vital and often businesses and various functions start with this management operation. Initial activities within a function also start with projects, for e.g. Launching a new product in the market or implementing ERP within the organisation. The products are developed at lab scale, tried at pilot scale and produced at plant scale.  To handle all these activities later in their careers, management students have to learn Project Management techniques and through planning and control techniques to execute projects.</span><br><br>

Two prominent issues would be use of open-access natural resources (where property rights are not well defined) and environmental public good provision. Apart from coming up with instruments to deal with these problems, the course would also discuss about market failures related to pollution. The study of the concepts and techniques of environmental valuation would be important. Topics covered would include those related to development and sustainability: the degree of substitutability between natural resources and produced forms of capital (namely physical and human) and limits to growth implied by it. Since economic growth of developing nations often involves rising pollution, the course would also spend some time on discussing the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC). The course concludes with “greening” the system of national accounts and attempts to include value of environmental services within the national product of countries (including the case for India).

The course aims to introduce contemporary tools of economic policy making to expose the students to the current literature of formal economic modeling.
This course attempts to find answers of questions like what determines the size and target beneficiaries of public goods, welfare programs, taxation policies, effect of corrupt public officials, politician-industrialist nexus, electoral-cycles on economic policies. 
The course takes a positivist approach of explaining economic policymaking, assuming all agents are rational and behave strategically, focusing on various kinds of incentives and constraints the policy-makers face under different political systems.

In this introductory course, we will explore a set of influential contemporary moral theories, and learn how these can be applied to some of the most pressing moral issues of our time. We will address some aspects of the following questions. Is there a criterion for distinguishing between right and wrong? Are morals culturally relative? What is the best human life? What might be the moral bases for accepting or rejecting practices like euthanasia, abortion, affirmative action, and civil disobedience? To what extent are we obligated to assist people in need? How ought we to treat animals? What might an ethical relationship between nations look like?

Beginning from the scientific definition of sustainability, the course gives exposure to substitution possibilities in human consumption behaviour and production decisions of firms towards more sustainable choices. The course also studies country level data to see if higher per capita incomes are associated with sustainable choices and better waste management. The course dives into what is a circular economy and how it is related to waste management. From generating energy from waste, incineration to recycling and less dependence on virgin materials, the course studies rules and regulations set by the government with regards to waste management and circular economy.
Having taken any principles level economics course would be advantageous for taking this course. Basic understanding of concepts such as consumer behaviour, production decisions of firms and how are they related to the aggregate economy would be needed for this course.  For any student at the level of MA in Economics or MBA, this course would be useful in that issues of behavioural economics and energy conservation, how the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) varies with waste generation and recovery and per capita incomes, business opportunities out of waste recovery from landfills and recycling waste would be covered. These topics are essential towards sustainable choices, sustainability and building a circular economy.

Do new bank branches in villages increase women's entrepreneurship? Does a petrol price hike reduce private transportation usage?

Such cause-and-effect questions on “Does X cause Y, or is X just correlated with Y?” are very relevant and come up in discussions in our day-to-day lives. However, the appropriate answer to such questions is very policy-relevant. Therefore, it requires a good understanding of the difference between correlation and causality and the methods that help differentiate between the two ideas. This course is essentially about learning how to find appropriate answers to the above questions.

In this course, students will learn the counterfactual model of causality, enabling them to identify the causal mechanisms that influence the relationship between two variables. For most of the course, students will receive an intuitive and theoretical understanding of the applied (microeconometric) research methods, followed by their applications through research papers and their practice in STATA. At the end of this course, students should be able to apply these methods to their research ideas and the corresponding data from any particular field of interest (development, education, health, labour, environment, finance, management, etc.).</span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>The exponential growth in digital technologies and their widespread acceptance has elevated several Ethical and legal challenges which need careful deliberation. While these technologies promote innovation intending to improve ease of living, they create serious issues on privacy, governance and societal impact. Ethicists have raised concerns over how digital technologies violate the core values of human existence and sought active measures to protect them. Regulating agencies have been looking for ways to regulate these new technologies to protect core human values. The regulatory framework, however, has lagged considerably in regulating technological advancements resulting in a wide gap between the technology and regulatory upgrades. Consequently, there is a growing emphasis on self-regulation by the industry and voluntary codes that bridge the current gap. 

This course looks at the Ethical and legal challenges posed by digital technologies, understands the existing regulatory framework and examines how self-regulation and soft law can help overcome the challenges. The course starts with an understanding of how digital technologies have raised ethical and legal concerns and why these concerns require immediate attention, particularly when the regulatory frameworks have not been able to keep up with the emergence of technology. In the next stage, the course looks at the existing regulatory framework for these digital technologies and how to strengthen these frameworks.

										<td><br><span>Behavioural finance is the study of how psychology influences financial decision-making. It challenges the traditional view in finance that investors are rational actors who make decisions based on logic and perfect information. Instead, behavioural finance suggests that investors are emotional beings who are susceptible to cognitive biases, which can lead to suboptimal financial decisions.
This course aims to help students develop understanding of the current topics of ‘behavioural finance’. It provides an interpretative lens on a huge and growing literature. The course denotes the study of finance based on credible assumptions about how people behave, often confirmed by psychological experiments. The course will create a link between finance theory and practice to human behaviour. It will build upon the established principles of corporate finance before moving into psychological principles of behavioural finance, including heuristics and biases, overconfidence, emotion and social forces. The students will learn how human behaviour influences the decisions of individual investors and professional finance practitioners, managers, and markets.

										<td><br><span>This course is an introduction to the basic concepts and standards underlying the financial accounting systems. It aims to build upon the important accounting concepts and principles including revenue recognition, inventory, depreciation, and understanding the accounting equation. The course focuses initially on how to record economic events in the accounting records (i.e., bookkeeping and accrual accounting) and how to prepare and interpret the primary financial statements that summarize a firm's economic transactions (i.e., the balance sheet, the income statement, and the statement of cash flows). The course adopts a decision-maker perspective of accounting by emphasizing the relation between accounting data and the underlying economic events that generated them thereby enabling the students to read, understand and analyse financial statements through ratio analysis. The course also explores the areas of financial shenanigans wherein the students will be able to learn how companies use financial statements to disguise economic reality.</span><br><br>

People working in organizations get affected not just by who they are, but also but who they are working with and aspects like their teams, leaders, organizational culture, change and communication. The course shifts away from the individual level to the group, and organizational levels of behavior drawing on concepts and practices from the field of Organizational Behavior (OB). This course provides a basic understanding of your own and others’ behavior, particularly in teams. It enhances your ability to communicate and work effectively with others.  Organization requires effective management of people and a clear understanding of human behavior and social processes. Managers need to have a good understanding both of themselves and of those whom they will lead. The prior knowledge of individuals’ perceptions, attitudes, and behavior will enable you to choose appropriate leadership styles and managerial practices to increase organization effectiveness and positive human outcomes.</span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>In the contemporary age of increasing integration among the economies of the world, questions such as why and how countries trade with one another, how international capital flows are decided, how do indigenous firms compete against the mighty multinational corporations, the relevance of interest and inflation rate differentials, how the international value of currency gets decided, and many more, call for the attention of students of Economics. Answers to these questions are not simple, and there scarcely exists a unique solution for any one of them. Nevertheless, principles of Economics, both Micro and Macro, often provide an interesting and effective framework on which the logic of international economic issues can be constructed.  																																					 														         International Economics provides an insight into some of these principles and equips undergraduate students in the field of management with the understanding of the functioning of the economies in a globalized world. The course covers essential theories of International Economics as well as empirical analysis of some of the most important global events that have altered the way in which economies have functioned over the last few decades. </span><br><br>

It aims to provide a basic and comprehensive understanding of the key fundamental concepts and topics necessary to understand an economy as a whole. 
In addition to introducing the various economic concepts like GDP, inflation, unemployment, interest rates etc., we will also understand their inter-linkages. For this purpose, we will study various markets that operate in any economy, viz., goods, money, capital, and labor markets. And, look at their interdependencies using a narrative-based approach where concepts will be revisited as and when required in order to complete the understanding loop.
Though there will be mathematical representation using equations and graphs. But the focus will be more on intuition in terms of understanding the underlying behavior which results in those representations.

The course covers three themes drawing high attention from the governments as well as other stakeholders including civil society and businesses. Conventionally the three themes; energy, environment and sustainability; are perceived through the lens of trade-offs. This perspective is changing in recent times. Policymakers, professionals and civil society actors are cooperating to align strategies and actions across themes to overcome societal and individual risks and to gain co-benefits and comparative advantage. In many environmentally proactive entities, “sustainability” is a core issue that is increasingly integrated with organizational processes, systems and strategies. Delineation of policies to align energy, environment and sustainability is a highly explored subject drawing interest from researchers and practitioners. The course is divided into four modules which combine distinct yet inter-related concepts around the three central themes. The sessions cover the landscape ranging from global, national to local, spanning technologies, management and concepts from social sciences and ecology. </span><br><br>

The critical source of   competitive advantage for these corporations is not their physical assets, but their people. It is people, not companies, who innovate, create new products, make decisions, develop and   implement business plans, penetrate new markets, and serve clients and customers. Workplace issues have become one of the fastest-growing areas of state and federal law. Employment-related lawsuits filed in courts have tripled in volume in the past decade, and now account for a tenth of all civil cases. Many state courts have experienced a similar burgeoning of their employment law caseloads.

										<td><br><span>This course will help students understand consumers at a deeper level, using interdisciplinary concepts and methods. 																																					 														        Understanding consumer behaviour needs an interdisciplinary approach – concepts and methods from several disciplines like neuromarketing, cognitive psychology, behavioural economics, anthropology, sociology, and more. Consumers often make irrational choices. Decisions are based on emotions and unconscious motivations – not only on rational logic. Consumer choices are implicit not explicit. Consumers cannot often express their motivations in response to traditional marketing research surveys. This is because consumers either won’t say why they made some choices (as the answers might not sound logical and reasonable) or they can’t say (as choices were made at an unconscious level and they themselves do not know why they choose a brand). The course will draw on the works of several neuroscientists and behavioural economists like Daniel Kahneman, Richard Thaler, and Dan Ariely. We will use behavioural economics experiments (‘Nudge’ as Richard Thaler calls it) to see how subtle interventions influence brand choices. We will explore how ethnography – a method of immersing oneself in consumer lives (used in anthropology and sociology) – can help us get under the skin of the consumer and observe the role of products and brands in consumer life, as lived and not as claimed in surveys. </span><br><br>

It becomes inevitable that the brand language be effectively transformed from one media to another without changing the brand image. Throughout this course, the focus would be to expose students to ideas, applications, experiences and opportunities that are relevant to today’s times. This course is primarily about creating visual artefacts that communicate effectively, but that does not mean you need to be an artist to succeed. Assessment will focus upon your efforts and your willingness to engage with your classmates to provide feedback and learn from one another. The more time you spend with the exercises in this course, the more skills you will develop as a visual communicator. Take the time to explore each exercise, take risks, and reiterate often. Don’t allow your first attempt at any solution to be your only attempt. Fail early and fail often. Learning what doesn’t work is an essential process in understanding what does work.

Operational excellence is critical for success in many service industries today, global competition and rapidly evolving information technology. However, understanding service operations is not easy. Services are intangible, highly variable, not storable or transportable and often involve distributed operations with a significant amount of customer contact. This means that most service operations look quite different than manufacturing operations, and they often require specialized analytical frameworks and tools.

										<td><br><span>Human resource management is the process of gaining a competitive advantage through
people. Organizational performance is driven by people, and it depends on certain measures.
Human Resource (HR) experts need to be skilled at planning and interpreting organizations'
people metrics. This requires a solid understanding of HR analytics, i.e., the systematic
collection, analysis, and interpretation of data considered to improve decisions about talent
and moreover the organization at large. The application of analytics is changing the way HR
managers quantify the value that people (i.e., talent) - a company’s biggest asset - have on the
organization's ability to succeed in the market or in its mission. For enabling managers to make
smart decisions about talent, HR needs to effectually leverage data. When equipped with
metrics that are suitably designed and easy to interpret, HR can render managers with
analytics to make decisions which will not only improve operations nonetheless also create
systemic advantages. Data and sophisticated analysis are brought in the dynamics to
effectively handle people-related issues viz., recruiting, hiring and promotion, performance
evaluation, leadership, collaboration, job design, and compensation.
The curriculum is of an introductory nature to the theory of people analytics. It is not intended
to prepare learners to perform complex talent management data analysis. At the conclusion of
this course, you will be able to understand that how and when hard data is operated to make
soft-skill decisions about hiring and talent development; therefore, you may level yourself as a
strategic partner in the company’s talent management decisions.
The course will help students in three distinct ways. One, it will provide students with the latest
grounding in current evidence on managing people, providing a knowledge base which shall
ensure that their future management is led by the best practices. Second, develop the
understanding and skills that are necessary to be thoughtful, critical consumers of data on
people management, allowing them to make an in-depth analysis as they make people
decisions. Third, provide direction and practice in conducting people analytics, preparing
students to gather their own data, and making students more skilled analysts. These goals will
be pursued through a mixture of case discussion, lecture, and hands-on exploration of a variety
of data sets. The course is intended to introduce you to the fact that Organizations flourish
when the people who work in them flourish. Analytics can help make both happen.</span><br><br>

The course will largely focus on contemporary forms of social identification but present them as historically and culturally situated, and mediated by global flows. In particular, we will consider the contradictory effects of new technologies and markets for contemporary forms of social identification and inequality, and the utility of difference for accruing cultural capital in a market economy. Course content is drawn from a range of academic fields of inquiry including anthropology, sociology, literature and cultural studies. </span><br><br>

A clear comprehension of the material in this course is essential for the successful completion of other courses in biology. The course covers modern biology at the molecular and cellular level and includes biological macromolecules, the biochemical and biophysical processes in respiration, energetics, metabolism, photosynthesis, cell signaling, and cell reproduction. These fundamental topics in turn lead to the genetic basis of life with classical and modern understanding of inheritance, an understanding of genes, DNA, RNA, and proteins, in sexual reproduction. The initial part of the course concludes with an introduction to biotechnology and genomics with an emphasis on laboratory techniques, genome mapping, and proteomics. The second part of the course applies our understanding of modern biology, including biotechnology, to viruses and single celled organisms such as prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea), protists, fungi, and to seed and seedless plants. No background is assumed other than basic chemistry and biology at the school level. This course can be taken by non-biology students and satisfies the general education requirement (GER).

										<td><br><span>The city of Ahmedabad has been at the crossroads of major historical currents. A key commercial centre of western India, Ahmedabad was at the vanguard of industrialisation in modern India. Ahmedabad via the coastal port cities such as Surat was a gateway to the sea routes of the Indian Ocean via the Arabian Sea, home to influences from West Asia as well as peninsular South Asia. Although the city functioned as a political and administrative centre, it had a strong tradition of craft goods production, merchant entrepreneurship, and banking and financial services.  It maintained thriving trade contacts with  neighbouring towns and port cities as well as imperial centres at Delhi and Agra. In 1700 AD, Ahmedabad was, by some estimates, the sixth most populous city in the world[1]. Today, it continues as one of the most populous cities in India, a key node of national politics as well as business and urban development initiatives and emblematic of the opportunities and challenges before contemporary Indian society, wherein modernist development paradigms have been superimposed on traditional social structures. The course will help students understand the city as an arena for economic activities (industry, trade and commerce, and informal work), merchant communities, entrepreneurship, city life and culture, and global engagement over the centuries. It will also examine the causes and consequences of conflicts over material and symbolic resources, which have been key to the social organisation of the city. It examines various efforts at urban development charting the city’s built form for the future. Through a combination of lectures, classroom discussions, and projects the course encourages students to analyse these historical and contemporary processes in Ahmedabad in the wider historical context of Gujarat. Through these experiences, students will receive an introduction to disciplinary concepts and theories that will be built upon systematically by later courses in the student’s chosen major.‘Ahmedabad as a Gateway to the World’ is a mandatory course for all BA students majoring in History or SPS (Social and Political Sciences), and for all Integrated MBA students.

Exercises (sentences, verses and passages) for each class will be drawn from original Sanskrit works (brief description below), and will be chosen so as to exemplify the key grammatical features which need to be explained.  																																					 														         The Pañcatantra is a famous collection of Sanskrit stories, in verse and prose, dated to around the second/third century CE and is considered a nītiśāstra (a treatise on government or political science). The Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa is one of the two famous Indian epics, a mammoth work comprising nearly 24,000 verses and which is of monumental importance and legacy.Each class will be divided into three segments: a revision of the past lesson(s) (and review of assigned after-class exercises), the scheduled lesson, and in-class exercises taken from Sanskrit literature. There will also be surprise tests to further reinforce the learning of various grammatical features. This course will prepare students to take the second of this set of courses (SAN102), wherein students will study more advanced syntactical aspects of the language. These two courses will prepare students with the adequate training in Sanskrit grammar to begin their study of original Sanskrit works in their second year of Sanskrit study (SAN201 and SAN202). Knowledge of the Devanāgarī script is not a prerequisite for this course. This is a core course for the Minor in Sanskrit Studies.Note: This course introduces students to Sanskrit as a classical language, and therefore, all evaluation during this course (class tests, mid-semester examination and end-semester examination) will be entirely open-book.

																This course is an introduction to modern written and spoken Persian. Students acquire the skills necessary to read, write, and speak Persian at an elementary level. This course is the first in a two-part sequence. The course works through approximately half of W.M. Thackston’s Introduction to Persian.
																																					
														        
Students learn foundational grammatical forms, build essential vocabulary, and become comfortable reading and writing the Persian script. Students practice exercises inside and outside class that build on the lessons from the textbook.
Students are expected undertake daily practice outside of class for at least 30 minutes.

										<td><br><span>Astronomy is one of the ancient areas of science like Medicine and Mathematics, and it has played a significant role in the society over several centuries. Even today, the human race is trying to understand fundamental questions pertaining to their existence in this tiny little planet suspended in this cosmos, and grapple with major questions like how did objects like galaxies, stars, and planets form? what are the contents of the Universe?.  The Introductory Astronomy course provides an overview of the objects in the sky, and makes students familiar with the foundations of the field, the scale of the Universe, the night sky, planetary motions, celestial positions and time, techniques of observation involving Telescopes. It gives insights of our planetary system and its objects, in particular the Sun, Moon and Earth. Moving outwards the course then explores the stars, including types of stars, the interstellar medium, and stellar evolution. The course unravels the science involving the birth, evolution, and death of celestial bodies, through hands-on activities using real astronomical data. The course explores larger distance scales with topics related to Galaxies and Dark matter. Finally, topics in Cosmology related to the expansion of the Universe and Hubble’s law are explored.  </span><br><br>

														        The world as we know it today is characterised by a high degree of globalisation, by the political and economic prominence of industrialised nations, and by the primacy given to science and technology in most societies.How did such a world come about? The course explores this question by tracing the development of modern science and technology and its relationship with imperialism and other engines of globalisation in the last five centuries. In it we will look at a range of viewpoints, thus trying to move away from a purely Eurocentric account. </span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>In this course, we will critically examine entities such as family, caste, class, community, language and nation, and ask how they generate powerful and sometimes conflicting loyalties among individuals. Are such associations natural and primordial, or contingent and historical? Do they have an economic rationale? How do the actions of state, law, and civil society mediate these attachments?  
																																					
														        
Over the course of 5 units— Family, Caste, Religion, Language,  and Nation— this course we will address specific questions such as: What is the history of the family as a unit? How did ideas such as the father as the head of the family, or the heterosexual couple as its anchors, come to be taken for granted? What is the social significance of marriage and how do we critically examine its current glossy, romanticized reinventions as elaborately staged spectacles? What is the significance of caste in our lives, and what is its place in Indian society? How does the Indian Constitution view caste? What is the relationship of religion to the state? Should it be private and contained within families, or spill over into streets and processions? Why have religious minorities, Dalits, and other groups at the ‘margin’ consistently challenged the idea of nationalism?  
This course builds on the understanding of the production of social identities in the introductory courses of the Social and Political Sciences programme and aims to develop a stronger theoretical foundation for analyzing key social categories. In this course, students will engage with a selection of texts focusing on categorizations along the lines of gender, family, caste, religion, language, and nation. Students will learn to critically examine these categories, their inter-connections, and the processes through which they are reproduced in everyday life.

In this endeavour, the cultural context is of crucial importance on account of the social, historical, and ecological distinctiveness of human experiences. Developmental Psychology also takes an integrative perspective on domains of activity like physical and motor, social relationships, emotions, cognition, language, morality and emotional, cognition and language, emotional aspects and moral dimensions. Furthermore, the study of development is contextually embedded in family, schools, peer groups, neighbourhoods and society, looking both at normative as well as idiographic patterns. Issues of developmental difference and disability will also be addressed with focus on developmentally and culturally appropriate interventions. </span><br><br>

Its development and advancement has revolutionised human activities. Be it the electronic instruments we use today, be it the development of solar cells as a renewable source of energy, be it the spectroscopy that we need for any biological or chemical discoveries, there is hardly any sphere of activities that does not need quantum mechanics. In this course the students will be exposed to this subject which involves the most dramatic departure from our understanding of the macroscopic world at the microscopic scales. Students will be introduced the probabilistic concepts in studying the microscopic world which involves both new theoretical developments as well as rigorous mathematical concepts from linear algebra, differential equations and many more. In Quantum Mechanics I, to start with, the failure of classical physics in the microscopic world will be discussed in terms of some very important experiments. Subsequently the idea of quantum mechanics will be introduced. Finally few simple quantum mechanical systems will be introduced and related mathematical concepts will be taught.</span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>What research methods do social scientists use to understand phenomena such as human experiences, processes, events, relations and networks? What does ‘fieldwork’ entail, and how do researchers define and construct a field? How do social scientists establish the validity, rigour and verifiability of their research questions and hypothesis, while remaining open to the inherently unstable nature of social relations? This course introduces students to research methods in the social sciences through a combination of reading, discussion and fieldwork practice. Alongside tracing some of the key debates that have arisen in qualitative social science methodology, students will learn about new and evolving modes of virtual qualitative field work such as navigating digital and remote sites of research students and the ethics and power dynamics implicit in conducting qualitative research. Each week students will learn about the practical skills as well as the theoretical aspects of conducting social science research. Through a series of practical writing assignments, in-class workshops and peer projects, students will learn key research skills— formulating  a research question, identifying an empirical research site, sourcing informants, rapport building, conducting interviews and practicing field note techniques. The teaching of research methods will proceed through a close reading of select texts, each of which highlight the possibilities and limits of particular methods- such as interviews, case studies, participant observation, etc. The last third of the course will be devoted to a short on-campus research project in groups or pairs where students will test the methods and approaches they have studied. The course is envisaged as a  stepping stone to help students embarking on their undergraduate thesis projects. 

The course is also designed as a methods course for graduate students in the interdisciplinary humanities and social sciences. For graduate students, the course will proceed as a reading course which enables them to start thinking critically about key debates in the social sciences, and the methods best suited to their own topic of study.

														        Nowadays, the world becoming flat and interconnected, people and goods move around across borders more than ever before. People even migrate and settle down in a different country. In Japan, the most aging society on the globe, there are many foreign employees working in a variety of fields, from social service to computer and engineering sciences. The number is increasing every year.This is an introductory language course that helps students understand every life in Japan and make students’ life fulfilling for their future by enabling them to build the Japanese language with cultural sensitivities and communication skills for reading, listening, writing, speaking and interacting with people in Japan as well as the people around them such as fellow classmates in the same community and people with different backgrounds and in different situations, such at school, college, work or in their communities and beyond.</span><br><br>

Research is an attempt to understand the world through systematic study—that is, through identification of a problem, question, or hypothesis; selection of methods to investigate the question, collecting data, interpreting data, and reporting findings. The process of designing and doing research is a mix of various elements including the world view and social location of the researcher (researcher positionality), the selection of what one wants to investigate (research problem/question), and how one goes about doing it (research methods). This introductory and project-based course will familiarize students with the philosophical underpinnings of research, and enable them to identify, compare and contrast different qualitative and quantitative research methods suitable for answering a question, apply their understanding to design a research project in small groups, collect and analyse data, and demonstrate basics of academic writing.</span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>Quantum computing is a rapidly emerging interdisciplinary field that draws from physics, mathematics, and computing. It has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of computation as we know it today.  Indeed, it has already been theoretically proved that for many applications quantum algorithms would be exponentially efficient than classical algorithms. This means quantum computers will be able to solve many problems that are practically intractable for classical computers. For example, quantum computes would be able to break all the existing public-key cryptographic algorithms used in online banking transactions. 
																																					
														        This course will provide an introduction to the mathematical framework of quantum computing. The focus will be on understanding how quantum algorithms work, although we will briefly discuss the physical realization of quantum computers towards the end of the course. Several important quantum algorithms will be discussed. Topics covered include quantum logic gates, quantum algorithms including the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, Shor's factoring algorithm, Grover's search algorithm, and optical photon quantum computer.</span><br><br>

Important explanatory concepts such as representation, agency, class, caste, gender, modernity, intersectionality, state, subject-subjectivity, and identity among others will be explored in a historical and analytical dimension, such that students come to understand what is at stake in identifying (or not identifying) something as an instance of one of these concepts. The course will also introduce students to the history of debates surrounding these concepts such that they understand the contestations around their use. The course consists of four modules:

The course will explore this question of how phenomenal experience emerges from the physical stimulation of senses by light, sound, pressure and chemicals in the environment. We have specialised systems to process diverse forms of sensory information. The stimulation by light activates the visual system, and sound engages the auditory system, and so on. The course will track the entire process of perception, from the stimulation of the sensory receptors to the emergence of conscious experience. Students will learn the fundamentals of sensory transduction, neural coding of sensory information, and higher-order processes responsible for assimilating and interpreting sensory information. The students will then use this knowledge to read and reflect on research in the field of perception as well as use the conceptual knowledge towards tangible outcomes.

																This enabling course will serve as a major elective for the Social and Political Sciences (SPS) major and as a free elective or General Education Requirement (GER) for students from across the university. Secrecy is itself the art and science of our political life, yet little enough is known about government secrecy and intelligence studies among ordinary citizens as well as scholars. Promoters of intelligence and government secrecy – usually those who are in power – have emphasized its important role for our society to function orderly, because the ends justify the means. On the other hand, guardians of a civil society – usually the ruled in a democracy, such as citizens, mass media and human rights activists – have exclaimed that power has been in abuse. Even those who are apathetic or indifferent among ordinary people with politics, become awakened by the political impact that secrecy has once it is revealed as scandals. We have no way of gauging the relevant successful cases of secret statecraft and government secrecy in general since we know very little about the whole cases of national leaders’ covert attempts to engage in government secrecy. As a result, we cannot be even certain whether cases of revelation are typical or atypical, or whether revelations were a result of government secrecy failures to reassure or other factors. Empirical evidence to prove or disprove government secrecy theories, thus, could be more speculative by necessity, but it is possible to test some theories with the limited information that can be gleaned from historical records and in social science manners, such as hypothetical deductive approaches. Therefore, through this course on intelligence and government secrecy, undergraduate students will ask themselves what secrecy is in the first place and what are the possible future challenges pertinent we have to face. Furthermore, since intelligence and govern secrecy studies pose many ethical and moral questions – for example, “Is secrecy itself necessary in intelligence?” “If so, how much secrecy do we need? And at what cost?” – this course challenges undergraduate students to face these very fundamental questions. Although these are tough questions to answer, they are worthwhile to look into. Additionally, technologies and intelligence tools change over time, so another question is, what legitimizes various types of intelligence collection activities like the eavesdropping of by? National Security Agency? How far does the government’s responsibility go and should go? These questions will prepare students for actual government jobs which social and political science major students, and any students, are mostly pursuing.  The course on intelligence and government secrecy is an intellectual journey that prepares undergraduate students to real-world politics where their survival skills are required and their innovative thoughts and ideas are needed.</span><br><br>

It will be of interest to any student in the university who wishes to develop a qualitative, social and political perspective on climate change. It will broadly help students analyse how the phenomenon of climate change is impacted by and in turn impacts socio-cultural conditions.Thus, on one end, top-down, using political theory, we will analyse global governmental action on climate change. On the other end, bottom-up, we will use sociology/anthropology, to study how different communities use their traditional knowledge to adapt to climate change. From a climate justice perspective, we will ask why and how is it that marginalized groups across the world disproportionately bear both the impact of environmental degradation and the burden of remedial measures to avert the climate crisis. We will read case studies on a variety of climate related issues such as: on air-pollution in Delhi, on the inadequacies of our high school climate education, on how communities recover from climate disasters in Asia and in the US, and on how villagers co-exist with bears in Uttarakhand. Classes will combine texts with discussions, films, lectures and student projects both within and outside the classroom.                                                                                                                                                      At the end of the course, as students conceptualize for themselves what effective climate action should look like, the course will give them the tools to both critique the current economic and political measures being taken, and to appreciate the complexity of such interventions. 																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>The course will provide an introduction to the theory of Complex Analysis at an undergraduate level. Complex Analysis is a beautiful subject. It has deep and interesting connections with many other parts of mathematics and is the foundation of many advanced areas in mathematics.  For example, one of the most important unsolved problems in pure mathematics is the Riemann hypothesis- a conjecture that the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function are complex numbers with real part 1/2. Besides its importance in pure mathematics, Complex Analysis also finds important applications in physics and many disciplines in engineering (for example, in electrical and electronics engineering and fluid mechanics). 
																																					
														        
The primary objects of interest in Complex Analysis are holomorphic functions. Unlike their real analytic counterpart, complex holomorphic functions have many remarkable properties. The important properties of holomorphic functions and their applications will be rigorously discussed while emphasizing the visual and geometric intuitions.  
Some important topics covered in the course are: A rigorous justification of the existence of Complex Numbers, Limits, Continuity, and Differentiability of a Complex Function, Analytic Functions, Cauchy-Riemann equation, Lucas's Theorem, Complex Power series, Abel's Limit Theorem, Conformal Mapping, Fractional Linear Transformation, Line Integrals, Cauchy-Goursat Theorem, Cauchy's Integral Formula and its Consequences, Local properties of Analytical Functions, The Calculus of Residues, Contour Integration, Harmonic Functions and their Properties, Infinite Products, and the Gamma Function.

																Theatre has evolved through time as an important tool of expression and communication.  It is not only a source of entertainment but can serve as a catalyst for social reform or development. Theatre also expands our connection to the larger world around us, and our empathy for lives lived differently from our own. A director or an actor thinks from the perspective of the diverse characters they portray, improving tolerance towards others in the society. The audience, in turn, becomes witness to worlds that they might otherwise not encounter or be familiar with. Studies have also shown that students who participate in theatre perform better in academics as it enhances their power to express themselves.This course aims to introduce students to the different forms and functions of theatre, inclusive of the wide range of roles theatre practitioners can take on, such as directing, acting and scriptwriting.  We will also simultaneously discuss how theatre relates to societal concerns, using theatre games to help students to find present day issues that are relevant to them. Importantly, we will work together on producing skits and script writing in peer groups to encourage students to work cohesively in groups, overcome their inhibitions and find the confidence to engage in creative self-expression.This course is at beginner level & doesn’t require prior theatre experience. It is open to all students at the University. It will run for  one session a week (for 3 hours) as in a lab course. It is offered by Kabir Thakore, the Director of the Scrapyard Theatre in Ahmedabad.

																Quantum computing is a rapidly emerging interdisciplinary field that draws from physics, mathematics, and computing. It has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of computation as we know it today. Indeed, it has already been theoretically proved that for many applications quantum algorithms would be exponentially efficient than classical algorithms. This means quantum computers will be able to solve many problems that are practically intractable for classical computers. For example, quantum computes would be able to break all the existing public-key cryptographic algorithms used in online banking transactions. 
																																					
														        This course will provide an introduction to the mathematical framework of quantum computing. The focus will be on understanding how quantum algorithms work, although we will briefly discuss the physical realization of quantum computers towards the end of the course. Several important quantum algorithms will be discussed. Topics covered include quantum logic gates, quantum algorithms including the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, Shor's factoring algorithm, Grover's search algorithm, and optical photon quantum computer.

The power of abstract algebra is embedded in its name: it gives us an arena in which we may study disparate mathematical objects together and abstractly, without considering a particular instance or occurrence. For example, the multiplication of numbers, symmetries of a molecule, dance formations, roots of polynomials, Australian kin systems, actions of a Rubik’s cube, and loops on surfaces all form groups. The main objects of study, in this course, are groups, which are abstract mathematical objects that reflect the most basic features of many other mathematical constructions. We will also study fields and other abstract mathematical objects, which can be thought of as groups with additional structure. Topics include group theory, emphasising finite groups; field theory, including properties and applications of finite fields.</span><br><br>

The class will enable them to adopt a structured approach to working on their thesis by setting concrete deadlines with well-defined tasks for each week. This includes approaching and finalising a faculty advisor in the first month of the course, who will guide them towards relevant literature, approaches and methodology. The course will facilitate them  to reflect on their writing both in terms of its style and content. We will draw on texts that explain the skill-sets needed to enhance the practice of research and writing. The course will also help students develop as a collegial academic, able to engage with the works of their colleagues, provide constructive criticism and judiciously incorporate feedback from others into their work. By the end of the course they will have a proposal of a thesis or capstone project, with first drafts of each component of a thesis or a project, that they will continue to polish over the rest of the academic year.</span><br><br>

																This is a global history core course for History Major.

The course considers the agency of trade and religion in mediating cultural identities in the Indian Ocean world. Trade involves the exchange of goods. Long-distance trade requires merchants to enter into exchange relationships with people from other cultures. Trade contacts facilitate reciprocal understanding by intersecting with myriad other aspects of human life including religious beliefs. Religion is often defined as a frozen set of precepts, rituals, and moral codes of behaviour. Contrary to this, religion in the early modern period (c. 1500 – c. 1800) exhibited an extraordinary dynamism and fluidity as it moved across geographies. By focusing on trade and religion in the Indian Ocean world, the course discusses the changing perceptions of different social groups as they came into closer contact. 

The Indian Ocean has been one of the oldest world regions that facilitated trade and cultural interactions. The exchange of goods, ideas, technologies, microbes, and plants was often mediated by merchants, mercenaries, and monks straddling across the Indian Ocean regions. In the early modern period, the diversity of peoples from Southeast Asia, South Asia, the Islamic heartlands, East Africa and Europe made the Indian Ocean an emerging globalising arena that brought multiple cultures and religions to closely interact. This led to the processes of identity formation, dissemination and adaptation of cultural practices, and contestations and compromises in forging an open, cosmopolitan society. Understanding this substratum of the historical past will enable us to better understand globalisation.

Students will learn the fundamentals of the painting process while exploring different mediums including acrylic, water colour, and oil, and also paper, canvas, and panels as support. Though this course is intended as an introduction to the methods, materials, and techniques associated with painting, discussions of art history will establish a context for understanding the discipline of painting more fully.
																					
														        																					
														        																					
														        																					
														        This course is also an introduction to objective observation of the world as we see it - not as we think we see it and rendering that view in artwork. Beginning with basic principles of painting, this course will continue to challenge and build students’ skill as a painter through representational, abstract, and non-representational style of painting. Among other traditional subject matters including still life, landscapes and cityscapes, our exploration may even include renderings of machines and biological specimens. Studio sessions will be majorly spent making paintings, which will touch upon concepts crucial to the creative process, including critical thinking, discipline, and spontaneity.
Students will complete this course with a basic but strong understanding of making paintings, and also develop competency, both visual and technical, involved in painting. The goal of this course is to give students the basic tools and ideas necessary to begin their own personal painting practice along with finding a means for self-expression through the medium of painting.</span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>This course will focus on the fundamentals of drawing while emphasising its role in the act of mark-making as a primal instinct of human beings. While drawing is often seen as a primary tool supporting creative research within art practice, this course will also consider drawing as an independent and intimate approach that offers a keen insight to both the creative process and one’s emotional state. To that end, it is a studio-practice course aided by strong contextual studies that will enable students to develop basic rendering skills, understand drawing as a form of action and gesture that is an affirmation of life. Students will be able to objectively perceive the world we live in, which forms the crux of art-making in any art form – including printmaking, photography, painting, and digital art.

There will be ongoing guidance and critique of works-in-progress, and discussions of finished works, which will touch upon concepts crucial to the creative process, including emphasis on hand-eye coordination, critical thinking, and spontaneity. This will also be supplemented with museum and gallery visits in the Ahmedabad city.
Sketchbooks will be an important component in this course; students will explore self-expression and alternative drawing methods as a part of their required initiative.
Students will complete this course with a strong understanding of what constitutes as drawing, and also develop technical skill and competency in the drawing process. The goal of this course is to perceive action and gesture as means to create art while also laying a strong foundation for anyone who wants to pursue other forms of art.</span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>Real Analysis is one of the foundational courses in Mathematics. It demonstrates the need for mathematical rigor in dealing with fundamental mathematical concepts, for example, the construction of real numbers, the concept of infinity, and the idea of a limit.  Real Analysis is useful in many fields in mathematics, such as Complex Analysis, Functional Analysis, Harmonic Analysis (including Fourier Analysis), Approximation Theory, Numerical Analysis, Dynamical Systems, Wavelets, Nonlinear Optimization, Partial Differential Equations, etc. Real analysis (including Measure Theory) forms the foundation of modern Probability Theory and finds applications in Economics, Finance, Network Simulations, etc. For example, concepts of Real Analysis are used in Economics in Classical Demand Theory (for example, in studying the n-dimensional commodity space R^n), in Marginal Analysis and in problems involving Constrained Optimization (for example, in the Utility Maximization Problem).  
This course will provide a rigorous foundation for the concepts discussed in courses on Introductory Calculus. The course will introduce rigorous Real Analysis at an elementary level and will cover the following main topics.
•	Well Ordering principle and the principle of Mathematical Induction
•	Countable and uncountable infinity
•	Formal construction of Real Numbers (R)
•	Properties of R
•	Sequences
•	Series
•	Limits
•	Continuity
•	Differentiation

The course proposes to inspire a passion for reading literature, particularly vernacular literary texts; reading literature in one’s own first language is not only a source of happiness, but also ushers one into the understanding about the social, cultural, historical and/or political contexts.     
Since the course is offered in Gujarat and the city of Ahmedabad, one of the special perks the course participants will be able to gain from, will be the presence of contemporary writers and poets of Gujarat. Up to two to three sessions will host an Expert Talk to be delivered by a renowned literary figure whereby the course participants will be able to discuss the literary texts with the very writer/poet of the same, or benefit from a dialogue with an acclaimed writer/poet.      There are no specific courses as pre-requisites for this course, though it is expected that students have basic fluency in spoken and written Gujarati.</span> 										</td>

										<td><br><span>We wear global brands, consume global media, enjoy world cuisine, and use westernized slang. We wish to study, work or settle ‘abroad’. Simultaneously, we remain passionately attached to national identities, personal communities and local products, practices and norms. Such contradictions are now a part of our everyday lives but are undergirded by complex historical processes of movement and flow- of production processes, labour, capital, technology and ideas. 
This course aims to ‘locate’ globalization, not by treating global and local as binaries, but by studying different approaches, understandings and critiques of what remains a slippery process and concept. Rather than treating globalization as an analytically isolable object, process or phenomenon, we try to understand how it is embedded in production, value, consumption, desire and politics. Thus, the course will cover broad themes including economic globalization, cultural globalization, political, technological and ecological globalization. The course will engage with abstract theories of globalization and also its concrete manifestations in different parts of the world. Finally, the course, will complicate salutary narratives of globalization by looking at questions of rising income inequality, cultural nationalisms and ecological crisis. 
Course material will comprise mainly book chapters and academic journal articles, complemented by commentaries in reputed global journals and videos and film where relevant.

										<td><br><span>What research methods do social scientists use to understand phenomena such as human experiences, processes, events, relations and networks? What does ‘fieldwork’ entail, and how do researchers define and construct a field? How do social scientists establish the validity, rigour and verifiability of their research questions and hypothesis, while remaining open to the inherently unstable nature of social relations? This course introduces students to research methods in the social sciences through a combination of reading, discussion and fieldwork practice. Alongside tracing some of the key debates that have arisen in qualitative social science methodology, students will learn about new and evolving modes of virtual qualitative field work such as navigating digital and remote sites of research students and the ethics and power dynamics implicit in conducting qualitative research. Each week students will learn about the practical skills as well as the theoretical aspects of conducting social science research. Through a series of practical writing assignments, in-class workshops and peer projects, students will learn key research skills— formulating  a research question, identifying an empirical research site, sourcing informants, rapport building, conducting interviews and practicing field note techniques. The teaching of research methods will proceed through a close reading of select texts, each of which highlight the possibilities and limits of particular methods- such as interviews, case studies, participant observation, etc. The last third of the course will be devoted to a short on-campus research project in groups or pairs where students will test the methods and approaches they have studied. At the undergraduate level the course is envisaged as a  stepping stone to help students embarking on their undergraduate thesis projects but has been modified to be suitable for graduate students in the interdisciplinary humanities and social sciences. For graduate students, the course will proceed as a reading course which enables them to start thinking critically about key debates in the social sciences, and the methods best suited to their own topic of study. </span><br><br>

This course is for students interested in Integrated Arts, Theatre, Performance-based practice and research. It aims to build skills and sensibilities in a range of visual and performance-oriented arts through hands-on introduction to the properties and functions of the Black Box. The PRACTICE sessions include: (a) ideation and production of a multi-medial performance based work; (b) construction and conceptualisation of a performance narrative; (c) introduction to a range of multi-medial artistic practices that intervenes in theatre-making and research practice. (d) Use of theatre and visual art based tools, concepts and methods to document the city. The city will be the main thematic around which art works will be developed in this course. The LECTURE sessions will help (a) contextualise the diverse artistic practices addressed; (b) integrate these learnings with the historical context of theatre-making practices in general and with the thematic context of the city in particular; (c) develop a comprehensive understanding of what is meant by the Integrated Arts as exemplified in Black Box theatre.  </span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>Scholarship on the topic of citizenship unfailingly reminds us that ‘citizenship is a contested concept’ or a ‘terrain of struggle’. While many of these contestations are peculiar to their contexts, one debate that has invariably shaped our understanding of citizenship is that between citizenship as a universal principle and that of group-differentiated citizenship. The principle of universal citizenship suggests that the benefits of being a citizen have been becoming progressively universal and equal. The group-differentiated understanding of citizenship, however, exhorts that a theory of citizenship that is blind to differences only deepens the marginalization that disadvantaged groups experience in society. This course will use this debate as a jumping board to dive into the Indian story of gendering citizenship. The use of ‘gender’ is often critiqued for its singular focus on ‘women’. This course will not necessarily be troubling that but will rather address the impossibility of a unitary category of woman. Drawing on critical intersectional feminist scholarship, this course hopes to provide a richly textured story of gendered citizenship in India.Women’s movements and feminist movements in India have played a vital role in transforming gender based discrimination from an object of social reform to a subject of Rights. That said, these movements have been called out for their bias towards middle and upper class/caste women. Through an intersectional approach this course aims to highlight the challenges posed by marginalized groups about their exclusions both from Indian women’s and feminist movements as well as from citizenship, while being attentive to the importance of feminist solidarity and coalition building across differences for inclusive citizenship. 

This course is organized around 3 Modules Politics of Representation, Assertion of Rights, and Forging Feminist Solidarity. Readings have been selected to reflect the heterogeneity that marks the category of ‘woman’ but also to highlight how gendered identities are constituted through claims for citizenship, in turn, shaping our understanding of state and community.  The Module on Representation is focussed on gendered struggles around inclusion in formal politics, a normatively male domain. While claims for political representation is in itself an assertion of rights, the course treats representation as a separate category because political representation often enables a more confident articulation of other rights. The module on Rights sheds light on the material realities of citizenship, its attendant exclusions, and the claims for rights-both in law and in practice- that these exclusions give rise to. Both group differentiated citizenship and an intersectional analysis troubles a number of citizenship scholars for their fragmenting effects. The module on Solidarity will focus on feminist movements that strive to build coalitions across differences for securing women’s rights of equal citizenship. The course underscores that despite its gendered exclusions the promises of inclusive and universalist claims of citizenship makes engendering citizenship an important analytical and political tool for addressing wrongs.

The aim is to understand and apply basic to advanced-level statistics concepts for analyzing biological data. The main objective is to avoid the perception that statistics is just a series of formulas that students need to "get over with" and to present it as a way of thinking—thinking about ways to gather and analyze data. There is no better way to do that than to base a course on real data analysis with the popular programming language R. So, analysis of real data sets available through the textbook would be a key component of teaching and evaluation. Data from various fields in biology will be used as examples and exercises and as aids in learning how to use statistical procedures.</span> 										</td>

Wielded properly, good writing hones critical thinking skills, inculcates discipline and a work ethic, and improves interpersonal and collaborative skills. This course is aimed at developing these skills by getting students involved in and working on a sustained writing project over the course of the semester.  Based on the conviction that excellent thinkers and writers, must first and foremost be good and critical readers who can extract information from the written word and deploy it for multiple purposes, this course uses the genre of the book review as the whetstone on which students will sharpen both their thinking and communication skills. Students will not only read and review a book relevant to their field of study and broader interests, they will also, if the book is appropriate, get a chance to publish their book review in an academic journal or website. </span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>Microbiology today is a well established discipline both within medicine and in biology more broadly, and in the post-COVID19 era it is difficult to imagine a world without a knowledge of viruses and bacteria and the havoc they can wreak in our lives. But the idea that such invisible creatures could cause disease is relative new in human history, less than 2 centuries, in fact. Microbes themselves were first discovered in the 17th century with the development of microscopes, and although their connection to disease was not understood until the 19th century, ideas about what caused and helped spread infectious diseases had existed for centuries before. This course surveys a history of microbiology through a close reading of a series of seminal papers representing important nodes in the history and understanding of the field juxtaposed with commentaries by other scientists or scholars in the humanities and social sciences who have put these discoveries in various historical, social, cultural and intellectual contexts.</span><br><br>

One has only to consider the number of different films and television shows where a superhero’s powers are attributed to a their genetic make-up or to mutations in their genes, the real players in the DNA story remain largely obscure. Sure, the names of Watson and Crick, and Rosalind Franklin as well as the phrase the “double helix” might be recognized by many, even if the details aren’t quite right, but how about names such as Friedrich Miescher, Albrecht Kossel or Oswald Avery to name but a few? An how many people know that DNA was first discovered way back in the nineteenth century as the stuff found in pus cells from discarded surgical bandages? Or that the inability of a fingernail to float in a sugar solution led to the design of an experiment dubbed by one renowned scientist as "the most beautiful experiment in biology"?

This course aims to introduce undergraduate level students to the basic concepts of theatre-making in the contemporary milieu. The course is conceptually built around three key frameworks— Meaning Making, Non-Hierarchy and Learning though Practice. These frameworks will be imparted through all structured practical sessions, student led discussions and class presentations conducted throughout the course. The sessions will introduce and expand upon three key elements of Theatre— Text, Body and Space. 

The course will focus on cultivating theatrical sensibilities in a novice student of theatre and on enhancing basic critical reflective skills involved in analysing and creating theatre performances. Students will develop a comprehensive understanding of theatre as a form where various elements like actor, stage, sound, objects and text come together in a designated space and time. The students will be encouraged to collaborate with their peers in order to understand the value and function of ‘interaction’ as the fundamental quality of theatre as an art form.

In this course, students will learn about the key debates that animate the Right to the City and apply it to make sense of urban transformations in the Indian context. By the end of the course, students will be able to answer core questions that animate the urban: what does the city mean to different people? Who gets the right to the city and why? What processes (social, political, economic and otherwise) shape urban spaces? And finally, in what ways does the city space shape our lived experiences? </span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>Representation theory is a branch of pure mathematics that has seen a lot of applications in recent years. In this branch, abstract algebraic structures are represented using matrices or geometry, which enables them to be studied from a different lens. These representations provide a bridge between abstract mathematics and its explicit applications in nearly every branch of mathematics as well as in related fields such as physics and engineering. In Combinatorial Representation Theory, combinatorial objects are used to model these representations.Our goal is to ask questions about these combinatorial structures and to count (how many there are), enumerate (how to generate them all), and understand the representation theory behind them. The interplay between algebra and combinatorics is very handy and both branches help answer questions from the other branch.After a primer on abstract representation theory, we will work on understanding the representations of the symmetric group. This will lead us naturally to some celebrated combinatorial algorithms, in particular, we will give a full treatment of the Robinson-Schensted algorithm and Schutzenberger’s Jeu de Taquin. Finally, we will use this background to understand the ring of symmetric functions from a combinatorial perspective.</span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>Temperature is not just a property of life; it is a property of matter. Nothing escapes its control. Temperature has been found to be linked to every aspect of a species' existence and survival on this planet. Based on major climatic models, Earth’s temperature is going to rise 3-6 °C by the end of this century, and this climate change-related warming is going to generate changes for many species populations and the ecosystems they inhabit. Climate change is now recognized as a major force driving alterations in the fitness, behaviour, distribution, and ecology of species across the planet. The unprecedented rates of climate change in the future have the potential to impact species survival, generation time, fecundity, response to stress, and dispersal. Still, the same change in temperature will not affect the same organisms equally at all stages of life cycle. This phenomenon raises serious concerns: To what extent does this phenotypic variation reflect adaptation to temperature? And what processes facilitate or constrain this thermal adaptation? This course will cover the temperature games on this planet's life theatre. This course is useful for students interested in thermal biology (Programmes in Life Sciences), developing thermal measurement techniques (Programmes in Engineering), understanding sustainable development (Programmes in Management), and public health issues like vector-borne diseases (Programmes in Public Health).</span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>The natural world is threatened by several disturbances that impact the survival of living organisms including humans. To protect the living world and for sustenance of biodiversity, the field of conservation biology has evolved. Since there is no silver bullet that will rescue a threatened species or eradicate an invasive one, the field of conservation biology attempts to protect biodiversity by relying upon a range of different tools and techniques, spanning diverse fields of study, including biology, engineering, medical sciences, and management. The overarching goal of the field of conservation biology is not only to protect biodiversity but also to create a peaceful coexistence between humans and wildlife. With this thematic background, the course will explain the concepts and principles governing the field of conservation biology. The course will cover case studies, through which the students will develop an understanding of the practical aspects of the field of conservation biology, how and in what ways the science-based conservation can be applied to protect the biodiversity. The chosen case studies will be covering a wide range of taxa, and will showcase research outcomes from both within the country and as well as from outside. The selected case studies will also highlight both successful and failed conservation attempts, in order to teach the students, the challenges associated with experimental science in the field of conservation and how science-based solutions can be translated to save the biodiversity of the planet earth.&nbsp;</span><br><br>

Course units will focus on the paintings, sculptures, and architecture of India, Pakistan, and Nepal. We will examine Jain, Buddhist, Hindu, and Muslim religious art, asking how these visual and material objects relate to religious texts and practices. While loosely chronological, the course is also structured around the collections at the L. D. Museum and monuments close to Ahmedabad, including Baroda Museum, Rani ki Vaav, the Sun Temple at Modhera, Hutheesing Jain Temple, Champaner,  and Sidi Sayyid and Jama Masjids. Most months, we will spend two class meetings at the L. D. Museum. These class meetings, along with the readings and writing assignments, will allow us to address a host of questions pertinent to the study of religion and art in general: What is art? How can art be understood as “secular” or “religious”? How can religious imagery be used to construct regional and national identities or to teach a philosophical doctrine? By examining the different ways in which various communities have used visual and material culture throughout a period of nearly 5,000 years, we can see more clearly the contingency of “religion” and “art” in specific contexts. </span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>This course is an intensive introduction to scholastic Sanskrit, covering not only aspects of advanced grammar but also - perhaps more importantly - initiating students into the practice of reading Sanskrit texts. This course will enable students to take further PhD level courses which may require the close analysis of scholastic texts in Sanskrit, in case the students become interested in pursuing this direction of research. PhD students often come to the University with varying degrees of prior knowledge of the language and this course will enable the instructor to identify the students' exact level and tailor the course accordingly. In order to do so, the course will proceed by way of reading Sanskrit texts in the original and students will be required to prepare before each session their translations of the text assigned. Depending on the students' ability and grasp of the language, specific grammatical topics will be discussed as needed.During the course, students will be assigned readings from at least two texts - one from a literary work (such as the epics) and the second from any intellectual discipline (śāstra) (such as philosophy, medicine, law, etc.). The texts chosen will also pertain to the specific research interests of the students, thereby serving a dual purpose. Firstly, this will enable them to understand first-hand the grammatical variations in the uses of Sanskrit across textual genres and intellectual disciplines (abstract nouns, compounds, verbal forms, etc.). Additionally, the close reading of such influential texts will enable students to identify the key concerns for the thinkers of the respective Sanskritic tradition, which may often be significantly different from those of the corresponding Anglo-European intellectual tradition. Such an understanding can also help shape the research topics that students may explore during their PhD.As is usually the case with Sanskrit reading courses, the texts chosen will vary from year to year depending on the research interests of the student and the instructor. For Monsoon 2025, we propose to read sections from the following two works: the Vālmīki-Rāmāyaṇa (specifically, Chapters 55-57 from the Araṇyakāṇḍa in light of the three commentaries Bhūṣaṇa, Tilaka and Śiromaṇi) and Śālikanātha's Prakaraṇpañcikā (specifically, the chapter on the nature of perception titled the Pratyakṣapariccheda in light of the commentary Nyāyasiddhi).</span><br><br>

Spanning 1300 to 1800, this transformative era has provoked significant historiographical inquiry, from colonial interpretations to contemporary analyses. Framed by the tensions between this period’s characterisation as medieval or early modern, the course examines key themes in the political, economic, social and cultural history of the period. Topics include state formation, political economy, land and taxation, religious negotiations and literary and cultural transformations. While attending to questions of kings and empires, this course pays special attention to the circulation of saints, soldiers, poets, and merchants whose overlapping multilingual and multidirectional networks have given fresh impetus to the study of South Asia between 1300 and 1800. Students will engage with a wide range of primary sources—including textual, visual, and material artefacts—alongside critical secondary readings. This reading-intensive course aims to develop students’ ability to critically examine primary sources, analyse diverse historical perspectives and contextualise the interconnected worlds of South Asia between 1300 and 1800.</span><br><br>

It begins with an examination of classical ideas such as liberty, equality, and justice with the help of both classical and more recent texts. The course then explores theoretical debates on the concepts of rights and power from various philosophical perspectives. The final section of the course shifts its focus to contemporary crises faced by liberal democracies through the rise of illiberalism/ illiberal politics. We interrogate the meaning of illiberalism, its global and Indian manifestations, and its intersections with state surveillance, Big Tech, and disinformation/ information politics.  Moving beyond the dominant Western canon, the course makes a deliberate attempt to incorporate perspectives from non-Western traditions, with particular attention to Indian political thought and theory. </span><br><br>

This domain understands individual and community experiences of place and time as being shaped by continuously evolving everyday practices and social structures. It will specifically attempt to think about connections between fields and archives - two important components in history and anthropology. Can the field move beyond physical spaces, and can the archive move beyond written/oral records? The course examines how time and temporality have been studied and how ordinary people form their subjectivity in relation to time through allied concepts like body, emotion, and experience. This is a reading and writing intensive course.</span><br><br>

While the course, taught from a practitioner's perspective, will focus on 21st century developments and prospects, it will be rooted in the evolution of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, and the Maldives since the departure of colonial powers from the Subcontinent, and the ensuing inter-relationships of conflict and conflict resolution. The course will discuss various regional initiatives such as SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation); the BBIN (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal) transport connectivity initiative; regional initiatives in energy, water sharing, and climate crisis mitigation; and trans-regional economic initiatives like BIMSTEC which also includes Myanmar and Thailand. The course will discuss the over-arching presence and influence of China, Myanmar and Afghanistan (a member of SAARC), with which South Asia shares vast borders. These regional neighbours are also active ingredients in South Asian outcomes in a range from security to migration, and, along with core South Asian countries, are increasingly a part of Superpower, or 'Super-Complex,' dynamics. This course will also discuss South Asia by looking beyond an Indian pivot to present the perspectives of other South Asian countries. And, conclusively, the course will discuss how the countries of South Asia can work to evolve a future of shared peace and prosperity.</span><br><br>

Evolutionary Biology is the study of the changes in life forms over time - changes that have occurred over millions of years as well as those that have occurred over just a few decades. In this course, we will look at the various mechanisms of evolution, how these mechanisms work, and how change is measured. This course will begin by reviewing the evolutionary concepts of selection and speciation, phylogenetics and history of life. We will then learn natural selection and adaptation, evolutionary processes, and genes-genomes-phenotypes. The course will wrap up with a look at the evolution and modern society. At the end of this course, students will have a better understanding of the evolution of life. Also, this course will prepare students for future study and research in macroevolution, microevolution, genetics, behavioral biology, evolutionary medicine, and computational biology.</span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>First Year Interdisciplinary Seminar on Critical Thinking and WritingThis course is an introduction to the early Indian diaspora, with a special focus on the late 19th and early 20th century indenture migration to the sugarcane plantations in the British colonies. Beginning with an overview of the global Indian diaspora, the course will then focus on migration caused due to the system of indenture. After the abolition of slavery, Indians were transported under the system of indenture (girmit) to the islands of Fiji, Mauritius and the Commonwealth Caribbean islands of Trinidad, Tobago and Guyana to work on the sugarcane plantations. Displaced from their place of origin, and often referred to as the girmityas, they grappled with the ideas of home and belongingness, often invoking nostalgia and longing for a lost homeland. The course includes different forms of readings that range from research essays and short stories, to interviews with writers, and even poetry rendition. Based on classroom discussions and written assignments, this course will enable the students to critically engage with the history of the lesser known Indian diaspora, that of indenture and servitude.
