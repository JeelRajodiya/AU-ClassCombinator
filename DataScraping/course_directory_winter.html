Over the years, it is becoming progressively complex due to innovations in financial markets, shareholder activism and influences from politicians and other stakeholders including financial press. Every day M&As are happening in the business world but only a few large ones are making media headlines. The Competition Commission’s intervention or NCLT’s ruling make further additions to the M&A news. M&As are the causes and results of corporate restructuring necessitated by both ups and downs of the national economy. The managements of the merging companies defend their M&A decisions. The employees become uneasy and skeptical about their future. The stock market reacts positively or negatively. While the overt motives behind many mergers are ‘growth’ through organic or inorganic combinations, the covert purposes can be driven by ‘managerial hubris’. But the fact remains; most M&As are failing sooner or later as the mysterious M&A chemistry is less understood. The failure rates are more in developing economies, even though successful CEOs strike the deals. Experts are unanimous in expressing that majority of failed mergers are the results of unscientific M&A decisions but it remains an exotic bets; win some lose some.    </span><br><br>

Professionals & organizations working or desiring to start a new venture in diverse fields require an understanding and insight of Project Management concepts and methods. Projects are vital and often businesses and various functions start with this management operation. Initial activities within a function also start with projects, for eg. Launching a new product in the market or implementing ERP within the organisation. The products are developed at lab scale, tried at pilot scale and produced at plant scale. To handle all these activities later in their careers, management students have to learn Project Management techniques and through planning and control techniques to execute projects. </span><br><br>

																This is a seminar course to discuss scenarios of professional practice and ethical aspects in heritage management. This is designed specifically for the Heritage Management students, and is to be offered in the final semester of the programme. The idea behind this course is not to ‘teach’ a particular way of professional practice and or a set of ethics, but to make students aware of multiple fields of practice in different settings, and to sensitize them on potential roles, responsibilities, rights as well as ethical concerns that may come in such fields of practices – particularly keeping in mind their own scenarios or career plans as they graduate from the Masters degree in Heritage Management.Heritage is a broad concept connecting to various disciplines and almost all levels of society. Heritage Management is an evolving field of practice which aims to keep the heritage idea in focus while working in development, planning, economic activities, community development, research and institution building etc. Hence, there are multiple avenues of practice that the graduates of the Heritage management programme may pursue – from being an individual heritage professional to taking a leading position in a heritage related organization, from setting up their own entrepreneurial business to venturing into a large scale corporate type set up tapping into any sector of heritage, i.e. textile or metal work etc., from joining a government department to working in the NGO sector, from being an administrator in a local urban body to being an academician, and so on. Accordingly, it comes with its own complexities and potential conflicts of interests too. It is in such contexts that this course aims to highlight the potential overlaps, conflict of interests, individual and societal rights, organizational behavior and ethics etc. that may be relevant to heritage practitioners. This is not an exclusive course to cover all possible topics and areas – which perhaps is impossible, but this is a course to trigger such sensitivities in the minds of future heritage managers, and to enable them to explore such issues and be prepared to frame their career plan and professional activities in a more just and responsible ways.

It is aimed at making designerly behaviour a very core mindset and bodyset.Design Thinking in the modern context is recognised as a core business activity which is capable of enhancing all activities around it, making them better and more human and consequently profitable as well. Over the years, it has developed as a very robust and ever-evolving combination of design, science, human behaviour and business principles. At the centre of this is the target user for whom systems are built to understand them, empathise with them define their problems and help them solve these problems through strategically targeted design interventions. Ultimately, all business is about the people who invest in it through one or the other level of consumer behaviour. Design Thinking is aimed at giving business thinkers, a very deeply strategic advantage in the market.The proposed course is an introduction to Design Thinking which is delivered through a set of 14 sessions, discussions, and structured assignments that help internalise these basic concepts. Several minor assignments and a major project serve as a vehicle for participative action that is central to the understanding of Design Thinking as applied to imaginative business models while understanding four key aspects – context, intent, recipients of the design and the system involved.																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

This is a global phenomenon, yet of particular relevance to the Asian and the Indian context.  																																					 														        What are the challenges as well as the perspectives of safeguarding and exploiting heritage at present and in the future? And, more importantly, how can cultural organisations identify, understand and respond to the ongoing change? The course aims at providing the theoretical models and practical tools that would enable cultural organisations to manage change, benefiting from some of the latest developments in the areas of business management, strategy and marketing.  In this context, the key challenges for cultural organisations are to: • be agile in the changing and fluid environment;  • achieve and sustain innovation over time; and  • maintain and increase their visitors and networks, securing financial viability and also contributing to the development of the local and the broader community.  A wide range of cultural organisations, international and Asian and Indian ones, from both the public and the private sector are used as case studies.

Do new bank branches in villages increase women entrepreneurship? Does a hike in the prices of petrol reduce private transportation usage?    “Does x cause y, or is x just correlated with y?” are very relevant and come up in discussions in our day-to-day life. The appropriate answer to such questions however is very policy-relevant, and therefore requires a good understanding of the difference between correlation and causality, and the methods that help differentiate between the two ideas. This course is essentially about learning how to find appropriate answers to the above questions.  In this course, students will receive an intuitive and theoretical understanding of the applied (microeconometric) research methods, followed by discussion on their applications through research papers. A major part of the course will require students to apply the appropriate research methods to the datasets provided to them and estimate the coefficients of interest in STATA.   At the end of this course, students should be able to apply these methods to their research ideas and the corresponding data from any particular field of interest (education, health, labor, environment, finance, management, international trade, etc.). 																 																																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>Of late, ‘Business Valuation’ has gained tremendous prominence due to various judicial pronouncements in India and abroad. In India, a new professional discipline on Valuation has been created through 2017-Valuation Rules and by setting up of Registered Valuers Organisations (RVO) for all purpose valuation. By its nature, valuation is not a precise science due to imperfections in the market and varying perceptions. A valuer may have perfect knowledge of the market but the market may not have perfect knowledge of the value. On every occasion there may not be a definitive value conclusion, but every valuation exercise is based on its circumstances and premise. There is nothing called correct valuation; valuation is an opinion and therefore, the principle of caveat applies. Valuation exercise needs methodical & logical approaches, careful application of the basic valuation principles and adherence to standards and practices. Therefore, a valuation professional needs to be better educated in order to make business valuation theories & practices better explained and better defined in the context. This course deals with various methods and techniques (comprising all the three internationally accepted approaches) of valuation to suit various purposes of valuation, following valuation standards, principles and regulations of the country. Emphasis is given on practical application of the concepts. </span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>The course's overall aim is to improve participants' ability to identify, structure, and execute cooperative strategies. In the last 20 years, we have seen the rise of business and platform ecosystems that create value by connecting various actors. The largest transport company (Uber) does not own cabs. The largest hotel accommodation and hospitality provider (Airbnb) doesn't own hotels. Controversies regarding Cambridge Analytica and Facebook have shown the damage a mismanaged ecosystem can cause. Given the evolving landscape, it is likely that participants will either be part of or compete with a cooperative ecosystem in the future.  
																																					
														        Managers trying to understand these collaborative value creation activities face several issues ranging from identifying various actors, source of value creation, how to structure an ecosystem, how to capture value, and at the same time manage competition and cooperation. This course introduces participants to frameworks and tools to structure and find answers to these problems. 
It is ideal for Post-Graduate Students and 3rd or 4th Year Undergraduate Students across Management, Economics or Entrepreneurship, and Family Business Disciplines.
The course is divided into four modules:
Module 1: Interdependence between organizations and actors
Sessions 2-6
Module 2: Cooperation and its implications
Sessions 7-12
Module 3: Coopetition
Sessions 14-17
Module 4: Cooperative strategies in action
Sessions 18-25

Cities are where future challenges lie, making them sites for various interdisciplinary interventions for human wellbeing, and socioeconomic and environmental sustainability. The global agendas of climate change and environmental sustainability, inclusivity and sustainable development goals must find solutions at the local level. Taking specific areas within Ahmedabad City (roughly equivalent to a city ward), the course will allow students to deal with the challenges under six key themes: public transport, public open spaces, public health, solid waste management, informal economic activities, and climate change (eg, floods, water shortage, and heat waves, etc). Three types of areas, historic core, suburban, and new urban areas will be selected. However, the geographic extent of the total study area would depend on the total enrolments.
For each of the challenges, national and international cases would be presented to the students using which the students would come up with local solutions.

Further, students would be introduced to different drivers of firm value. In doing so, students would be exposed to aspects such as capital budgeting, capital structure and working capital management. While the course per se would help the student navigate the different strands of financial management both at an individual level as well as at the firm level, such navigations are not only meant to build competency in individual strands, but also to help students attain an integrated perspective -one that is anchored on value creation.</span><br><br>

																Heritage is not only about the past; heritage management is not only about preserving, and ‘freezing’, the past in the present. Heritage is also living, continuing and evolving into the present and the future; and heritage management is also about sustaining continuity and managing evolution. 
																																					
														        Within this framework, ‘living heritage approach’ (LHA) is an approach to heritage management that: 
• sees heritage as part of the identity of the contemporary local communities; 
• empowers local communities in the heritage management process, recognizing their traditional knowledge, management systems and maintenance practices; and
• links heritage management to sustainable development, by making heritage relevant to the socio-economic needs of the contemporary local communities. 
LHA could be considered an innovative approach in the sense that it is different from, and moves beyond, values-based approach – i.e. the current most preferred approach to heritage management, adopted, and advocated by major conservation authorities, both at national level (e.g., USA, Canada, Australia, and UK) and at international level (e.g., UNESCO World Heritage Centre), and by major research and educational institutions (e.g., the Getty).
LHA is of international scope, yet of particular relevance to the Asian and Oceanic and the Indian context, and specifically to the World Heritage City of Ahmedabad, respecting the local religious and cultural traditions and bringing significant benefits to the local communities.
The course: 
• presents the key characteristics and the planning process methodology for the application of the LHA;
• examines the application of the LHA in a wide range of heritage sites such as religious sites and historical towns and villages; and
• highlights the contribution of the LHA to reconciling development/energy infrastructure to heritage sites and local communities.
A wide range of heritage sites, international and Asian-Oceanic and Indian ones, are used as case studies.
The ultimate aim of the course is to help current and potential heritage managers understand the importance and develop methodologies of involving, and empowering, local community and civil society members in the heritage management process. Above all, the course encourages current and potential heritage managers to adopt a new ‘paradigm’ that would recognize the local communities as the long-term custodians of their heritage and themselves as the supporters and mediators – towards the continual creation of heritage in the present and the future. 
The course addresses undergraduate and postgraduate students interested in heritage sites (religious sites, historical towns and villages) and local communities, and in tourism.

Therefore, branding is a function of strategy and psychology that embeds various facets of design in it.This course is designed to cover the fundamentals of branding and packaging to sensitize you to the decision-making process required to create a cohesive brand language. In a world dominated by brands, it is important to understand the key differentiating factor and then build an experience around it. Strategic Packaging design directly contributes to building a brand image by functional or aesthetic elements or by reinforcement of brand image by giving out an experience. This course will offer the tools and techniques required to formulate the right strategy for success.The pedagogy consists of interactive sessions with a healthy mix of fundamental theory, case studies, on the spot, and group assignments for hands-on learning.Your key takeaway from this course will be the ability to make smart decisions for building a successful brand image and a long-term plan for a lasting brand impression.																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>Interaction design is the practice of designing interactive digital products, environments, systems, and services.Ideally, interacting with technology would be as easy and intuitive as interacting with other humans. So, why do so many products and services fail to achieve this ideal? All products, whether digital or otherwise, must deliver a high-quality user experience or risk losing users to competitors.The focus of interaction design is on user-centred design based on the understanding of real users including their experiences, goals, needs, wants and tasks. The goal of interaction design is also to collect and analyse data to make informed interface design decisions which are critical to creating and delivering successful products, services and systems that fulfil the user/customer, technological and business needs. </span><br><br>

It brings the power of computational analysis to problems and possibilities in humanities and related disciplines. This course aims to inform students of transdisciplinary research being undertaken within the purview of DH to equip them with the ability to hypothesise and 'critically-make' new media projects.The students are expected to incorporate a 50:50 ratio in their study of theory and implementing solutions hands-on. Students will be guided to prototype solutions that bridge their primary field of study with the Humanities. The course will result in the culmination of a final project answering a research question. Students will engage closely in a project that results in the culmination of a DH-platform as part of their evaluation.The tools that will primarily be used are Python, Google Collab, miscellaneous OpenAccess methods for text, network, spatial analyses will be encouraged. Students need not have any prior knowledge of these tools to register for this course. The coursework would broadly involve the creation of a data essay, a piece of alternative or multimodal writing and towards the development of an OpenAccess digital platform to highlight digital scholarship in Indian galleries, libraries, archives and museums (GLAM) for he general public.</span><br><br>

An organization with a project culture is one that knows where it is going, is focused on results and has a professional team who knows what is expected of them. Professionals & organizations working or desiring to start a new venture in diverse fields require an understanding and insight of Project Management concepts and methods. Projects are vital and often businesses and various functions start with this management operation. Initial activities within a function also start with projects, for e.g. Launching a new product in the market or implementing ERP within the organisation. The products are developed at lab scale, tried at pilot scale and produced at plant scale.  To handle all these activities later in their careers, management students have to learn Project Management techniques and through planning and control techniques to execute projects.</span><br><br>

Such behaviour of economic as well as financial variables is studied in detail in time series econometrics. The above questions are a few examples in this regard. This course goes beyond the traditional use of time series analysis to forecast the time path of a variable. It is extremely relevant to decompose a series into deterministic and stochastic components for making forecasts, interpretation of economic data, drawing causal inferences and the direction of causality. The serial dependence structure demonstrates a difference equation with both deterministic and stochastic components, whose solution(s) yields a time path of a single series or a vector of many interdependent series.
This advanced graduate course will familiarise students with modelling and forecasting of time series data. It will expose them to the basic techniques of time series econometric analyses and its applications in economics and finance. The course is designed to provide hands-on training in econometric software(s) such as R, which is an open source free software to critically analyse and investigate pertinent empirical questions in the real world.

																The course discusses the core concepts of sustainability. Beginning from the scientific definition of sustainability, the course gives exposure to substitution possibilities in human consumption behaviour and production decisions of firms towards more sustainable choices. The course also studies country level data to see if higher per capita incomes are associated with sustainable choices and better waste management. The course dives into what is a circular economy and how it is related to waste management. From generating energy from waste, incineration to recycling and less dependence on virgin materials, the course studies rules and regulations set by the government with regards to waste management and circular economy. 

Having taken any principles level economics course would be advantageous for taking this course. Basic understanding of concepts such as consumer behaviour, production decisions of firms and how are they related to the aggregate economy would be needed for this course.  For any student at the level of MA in Economics or MBA, this course would be useful in that issues of behavioural economics and energy conservation, how the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) varies with waste generation and recovery and per capita incomes, business opportunities out of waste recovery from landfills and recycling waste would be covered. These topics are essential towards sustainable choices, sustainability and building a circular economy.

The course adopts a decision-maker perspective of accounting by emphasizing the relation between accounting data and the underlying economic events that generated them thereby enabling the students to read, understand and analyse financial statements through ratio analysis. The course also explores the areas of financial shenanigans wherein the students will be able to learn how companies use financial statements to disguise economic reality.</span><br><br>

In doing so, students are introduced to the different types of derivatives instruments that are available in the market place, their utility, and the attendant market structures and price mechanisms pertaining to such derivative instruments. Further, students are exposed to pertinent risk management strategies that can be undertaken by market participants at different levels of the value chain so as to mitigate different risks. 																	 The 1991 big bang reforms in general and the financial sector reforms in particular, among many things, led to the establishment of cutting-edge state-of-the-art institutions such as National Stock Exchange (NSE) and National Securities Clearing Corporation Limited (NSCCL; now renamed as NSE Clearing Limited.), which in turn have played an instrumental role in development of vibrant derivatives market in India. This has catapulted India in global league when it comes to derivatives trading activity. Consequently, this course is also geared to making students appreciate the opportunities and challenges with respect to Indian derivative markets, without losing sight of the regulatory actions that have enabled the prevalence of derivatives market in the first place.   </span><br><br>

The course shifts away from the individual level to the group, and organizational levels of behavior drawing on concepts and practices from the field of Organizational Behavior (OB). This course provides a basic understanding of your own and others’ behavior, particularly in teams. It enhances your ability to communicate and work effectively with others.  Organization requires effective management of people and a clear understanding of human behavior and social processes. Managers need to have a good understanding both of themselves and of those whom they will lead. The prior knowledge of individuals’ perceptions, attitudes, and behavior will enable you to choose appropriate leadership styles and managerial practices to increase organization effectiveness and positive human outcomes.																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

Answers to these questions are not simple, and there scarcely exists a unique solution for any one of them. Nevertheless, principles of Economics, both Micro and Macro, often provide an interesting and effective framework on which the logic of international economic issues can be constructed.  																																					 														         International Economics provides an insight into some of these principles and equips undergraduate students in the field of management with the understanding of the functioning of the economies in a globalized world. The course covers essential theories of International Economics as well as empirical analysis of some of the most important global events that have altered the way in which economies have functioned over the last few decades. </span><br><br>

										<td><br><span> 																 																 																 																 																 																 																 																 																 																 																 																 																 																 																Globalization has generated the continuing internationalization of the world’s production system, with increasingly prevalent global supply chains frequently making it impossible to identify a single national origin of finished products – they tend to be made “in the world”. This has resulted in considerable new openings for economic development and employment-led paths out of poverty for hundreds of millions of people, but also the danger of global competitive processes placing downward pressures on working conditions and respect for fundamental rights. The onward process of the internationalization of production coincides with the continuation of primarily nationally-based labour-market institutions, legislation and processes, with consequences for the future governance of work.Despite the extraordinary development of production through successive technological revolutions, this basic imperative to work is still with us in the contemporary world. Fundamental human needs still go unmet and the war on want is unfinished because poverty persists; a large part of the global workforce is still engaged in subsistence production.The individual will want to find meaning and purpose in work and material compensation for it that allows him or her to become an independent, full and valued actor in society. The workplace itself is also where socialization processes initiated in education are deepened and where many of the individual’s social relations are forged and maintained. These are all reasons why the future of work will dictate many facets of the future of our societies and  organisations. The course focuses on the these isseus of work and organisations and tries to give a thought to tomorrow’s manager what they might expect ? 																 																 																																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

Understanding consumer behaviour needs an interdisciplinary approach – concepts and methods from several disciplines like neuromarketing, cognitive psychology, behavioural economics, anthropology, sociology, and more. Consumers often make irrational choices. Decisions are based on emotions and unconscious motivations – not only on rational logic. Consumer choices are implicit not explicit. Consumers cannot often express their motivations in response to traditional marketing research surveys. This is because consumers either won’t say why they made some choices (as the answers might not sound logical and reasonable) or they can’t say (as choices were made at an unconscious level and they themselves do not know why they choose a brand). The course will draw on the works of several neuroscientists and behavioural economists like Daniel Kahneman, Richard Thaler, and Dan Ariely. We will use behavioural economics experiments (‘Nudge’ as Richard Thaler calls it) to see how subtle interventions influence brand choices. We will explore how ethnography – a method of immersing oneself in consumer lives (used in anthropology and sociology) – can help us get under the skin of the consumer and observe the role of products and brands in consumer life, as lived and not as claimed in surveys. 																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

The course will expose the students to the user-centric approach that design adopts to address local and global challenges. They will learn to recognise that design is exploratory in nature and helps navigate ambiguity. It promotes new ways of looking at problems and coming up with solutions which are human-centered and inclusive.With practical exercises, the course will give an overview of the critical design thinking used for problem identification and opportunity mapping in any given context. Students will gain an understanding of design as a creative problem-solving tool to come up with holistic solutions for products, services, systems and experiences. The course is expected to rouse a student’s interest in design. It will equip them with the necessary grounding to pursue design as a higher education or career pathway. Importantly, it will add a richer and diverse perspective to their understanding of their own field of Major education be it management, technology, sciences, humanities or social sciences.This course is open for students who are admitted to any programme at the University																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>Visual/Creative communication in the digital age requires familiarisation and literacy that goes way beyond – beyond traditional practices. Digital is no longer a grey area. It becomes inevitable that the brand language be effectively transformed from one media to another without changing the brand image. Throughout this course, the focus would be to expose students to ideas, applications, experiences and opportunities that are relevant to today’s times. This course is primarily about creating visual artefacts that communicate effectively, but that does not mean you need to be an artist to succeed. Assessment will focus upon your efforts and your willingness to engage with your classmates to provide feedback and learn from one another. The more time you spend with the exercises in this course, the more skills you will develop as a visual communicator. Take the time to explore each exercise, take risks, and reiterate often. Don’t allow your first attempt at any solution to be your only attempt. Fail early and fail often. Learning what doesn’t work is an essential process in understanding what does work. This course is open for students who are admitted to any programme at the University.    </span><br><br>

Does the COVID19 shock have a transitory or persistent effect on macroeconomic indicators like economic growth, unemployment, interest rates and inflation? How do institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund forecast growth rates of nations?Such behaviour of economic as well as financial variables is studied in detail in time series econometrics. The above questions are a few examples in this regard. This course goes beyond the traditional use of time series analysis to forecast the time path of a variable. It is extremely relevant to decompose a series into deterministic and stochastic components for making forecasts, interpretation of economic data, drawing causal inferences and the direction of causality. The serial dependence structure demonstrates a difference equation with both deterministic and stochastic components, whose solution(s) yields a time path of a single series or a vector of many interdependent series.This advanced undergraduate course will familiarise students with modelling and forecasting of time series data. It will expose them to the basic techniques of time series econometric analyses and its applications in economics and nance. The course is designed to provide hands-on training in econometric software(s) such as R, which is an open source free software to critically analyse and investigate pertinent empirical questions in the real world.</span><br><br>

										<td><br><span> 																																					 														        Conventional wisdom associates ‘development’ with industrialisation. We often talk of ‘industrialised’ and ‘developed’ countries in the same breath. But what exactly constitutes industrialisation? What effects does it have on the structure of society? How is it related to science, technology and business? Is industrialisation driven from above (by governments) or from below (by entrepreneurs)? These questions are particularly important today as we face climate change and other environmental challenges.Such questions will be explored in this course through the history of industrialisation in several locations including Britain, continental Europe (especially Germany), the USA, Japan and India. A broad time-period will be covered, starting with the Industrial Revolution in eighteenth-century Britain and coming down to the present day. This is in accordance with newer approaches to the study of industrialisation, which look at the phenomenon on a global scale, rather than focusing on a few (Western) countries (Stearns 2012).</span><br><br>

It focuses on the key principles of music that formulate these genres and connect them to each other, the connection which eventually weaves the complex and diverse fabric called ‘Indian Music’. The course also tries to understand the relationship of culture and music through the dynamics of above mentioned genres. This course combines Theory and Practice thus students are expected to perform some vocals and also do some writing during the course. </span><br><br>

																This course introduces students to some of the most influential theories and philosophies that have informed the study and writing of history. Students will learn a variety of theoretical and historical perspectives for viewing the world and thinking about historical studies, in general. 
Students will explore the development of historical understanding and the various problems and approaches to the study of history. Student will read, discuss, and write about some of the most important works of theory and historiography. As E.H. Carr tells us, “interpretation enters into every fact of history.” Yet, historians often disagree about those interpretations. Through this course, students will recognize the ways in which those disagreements are often rooted in conflicting perspectives about the nature of reality, forms of power, human nature, and truth. 
We discuss a different theme each week including post-colonialism, gender, memory, and ‘universal’ history; and engage with major thinkers such as Hegel and Marx. 
Normally, the class reads one essay per session in order to give it close attention, but longer essays may be spread across two class meetings. A typical class meeting consists of a lecture, reading together as a class, and discussion. Students should expect to read 30-40 pages per week.

Cities are where future challenges lie, making them sites for various interdisciplinary investigations as well as solutions for human wellbeing and environmental sustainability. Today, more than half the world population lives in cities, creating the need for grounding of all social sciences, physical sciences, and professional works within the cities. Cities are spaces of opportunities as well as challenges given that there is no turning back the clock of history. Grounded within the Indian context, this course is divided into three broad segments that: one introduces students to important concepts and frameworks through which to understand various facets of a city; two introduces the challenges facing contemporary Indian cities and three unpack these challenges from the vantage of specific groups in the cities so as to move towards initial solutions. The challenges are presented through case studies and are related to the everyday living of urban residents with respect to employment and poverty, health, infrastructure, housing, ecology and pollution, climate change impacts, crime and violence and inequality. 
The course attempts to sensitise students to these challenges experienced by different populations in a city and solutions they bring on board. The sequel to this course would be towards systemic as well as decentralised solutions within the domains of urban planning and governance.  This course and its sequel will be of interest to the students thinking of future careers in urban management, urban and/ or development policies, climate change solutions, public health, media and social work sector.

How have classical theories conceptualised the state and society? How is the historical evolution of the state and society in the West different from the way they have evolved in the Global South, especially in India? The big transformations in information technology and capitalism in the 21st century have fundamentally impacted the state and social interactions. Through a focus on theory and empirical studies, the course explores five key themes or dimensions of the state-society interaction: 1. What is the state?; 2. What is society?; 3. Civil Society, social movements and citizenship; 4. Sociality and politics in the age of internet; 5. State, market society and neoliberalism.   The course will explore the following questions pertaining to its five themes: 1.	What are the important theoretical perspectives about the state (Weberian and Marxist)? How is the state experienced in the everyday lives of people in India?  2.	What does social theory tell us about the fundamental elements of society and social life (Emile Durkheim)? What are the dominant features of pre and post-independent Indian society? 3.	What is civil society and does it always strengthen democracy? How do social movements challenge the existing status quo of the state and society and when do they fail to do so?  4.	How has digital media technology transformed classical notions of the public sphere and what are its implications for social relations and harmony?   5.	What is market society and how has market thinking permeated social lives? What is the history and rise of neoliberalism and why is it best understood as a political project? 																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

Students continue their study of Sanskrit grammar and are introduced to more complicated aspects such as participles, rarer verbal forms, compounds, etc. Exercises are here too drawn from several well known Sanskrit sources, such as the Mahābhārata and Rāmāyaṇa.Students complete the textbook, Saṃskṛta-Subodhinī (chapters 16 onwards, same textbook as in SAN101) with occasional supplemental materials distributed by the instructor and a review in the first week of earlier chapters. Depending on the speed of the class, the end of the semester may include reading basic Sanskrit texts. Students are graded on reading preparedness, weekly assignments and a final exam.</span><br><br>

In this process, context factors are of crucial importance on account of the social, historical, and ecological distinctiveness of human experiences. In light of this understanding, Developmental Psychology takes an integrative perspective on multi-domains such as physical and motor coordination, social relationships formations and social knowledge, emotions, and cognition such as language acquisition. Furthermore, the study of development is understood in specific contexts like family, schools, peer groups, neighborhoods and society, looking both at normative as well as idiographic patterns. Issues of developmental difference and disability will also be addressed with focus on individually and systematically appropriate interventions.  																 																 																																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

And what roles does it play in society?Culture—referring broadly to shared meanings and behaviours among groups of people—has been a central concept in several disciplines in the Social Sciences and Humanities. ‘Culture’ and ‘cultural’ have functioned as objects of study as well as lenses for illuminating social, political and economic phenomena.

										<td><br><span> 																 																 																 																This undergraduate course is a survey of empire in Indian history. It focuses on the historical experiences of empire, the self-image and ideologies of the political elites, and their dealings with the diverse groups of people and the local-level power holding communities. How did the entanglements between ruling elites and subject population help Indians to imagine themselves and their position in the world? The course further discusses the territory, trade routes, taxation or resource extraction, and redistribution. Furthermore, what role did the natural environment, political culture and institutions, and different communities play in the emergence and the functioning of empire? Finally, it asks how Indian society has been shaped by the collective memories and legacies of empire. Introducing the substrata of India’s political and economic past, it discusses key themes around the state formation and empire building processes.  																																					 														         The term empire acquired a negative connotation thanks to the British colonial high-handedness and the bitter experiences of decolonisation movements. However, the empire that Indians knew, lived in and experienced was not necessarily bad. For a long span of time, over the last two millennia, Indians lived and worked within one or the other empire. Compared with the long history of empire, the modern nation state is new. It is an adapted concept from nineteenth-century Europe. In several respects, the nation state appears to be lacking in meeting the demands of a “civilisation-state” i.e. India with its enormous diversity.  Discussion of empire and institutions can help form a more nuanced understanding the contemporary Indian society.     																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

																This ENABLE course is a Major Elective for the CHM students. 

Cities are where future challenges lie, making them sites for various interdisciplinary investigations as well as solutions for human wellbeing and environmental sustainability. Today, more than half the world population lives in cities, creating the need for grounding of all social sciences, physical sciences, and professional works within the cities. Cities are spaces of opportunities as well as challenges given that there is no turning back the clock of history. Grounded within the Indian context, this course is divided into three broad segments that: one introduces students to important concepts and frameworks through which to understand various facets of a city; two introduces the challenges facing contemporary Indian cities and three unpack these challenges from the vantage of specific groups in the cities so as to move towards initial solutions. The challenges are presented through case studies and are related to the everyday living of urban residents with respect to employment and poverty, health, infrastructure, housing, ecology and pollution, climate change impacts, crime and violence and inequality. 

The course attempts to sensitise students to these challenges experienced by different populations in a city and solutions they bring on board. The sequel to this course would be towards systemic as well as decentralised solutions within the domains of urban planning and governance.  This course and its sequel will be of interest to the students thinking of future careers in urban management, urban and/ or development policies, climate change solutions, public health, media and social work sector.

We will read these primary sources in the original (and in the case of Hind Swaraj in translation) to explore the divergent ideas of India that emerged through the writings of the three barristers, wherein categories like caste, nation and people became contested.

																Stephen Hawking famously declared in his 2010 work The Grand Design that ‘philosophy is dead’. This course takes as its starting point this very claim, and seeks to introduce students to great philosophical ideas – from across space and time.  In order to do this, this course first introduces the meaning and practice of philosophy across various traditions – Western, Islamic, Indian, Chinese, Japanese and African – and then proceeds to consider a few pivotal philosophical problems and the varying responses found across these traditions. In doing so, the course not only presents students with some timeless philosophical concerns and their illustrious responses through history but demonstrates also how distinct traditions have valued different solutions, and indeed different questions. The course thus considers Hawking’s claim of philosophy’s death by probing the question if philosophy can die.
																																					
														        A caveat: it is of course impossible for any course to adequately cover all traditions or indeed all concerns and approaches of any specific tradition.

Research is an attempt to understand the world through systematic study—that is, through identification of a problem, question, or hypothesis; selection of methods to investigate the question, collecting data, interpreting data, and reporting findings. The process of designing and doing research is a mix of various elements including the world view and social location of the researcher (researcher positionality), the selection of what one wants to investigate (research problem/question), and how one goes about doing it (research methods). This introductory and project-based course will familiarize students with the philosophical underpinnings of research, and enable them to identify, compare and contrast different qualitative and quantitative research methods suitable for answering a question, apply their understanding to design a research project in small groups, collect and analyse data, and demonstrate basics of academic writing.</span><br><br>

																Human activities severely impact the environment and the ecosystems. Environment is not yesterday’s concern; it is
today’s worry on how society should develop sustainable strategies to coexist with the surrounding environment.The
process of developing a sustainable environment is complex, and requires understanding of natural, constructed and
cultural environments. The course on ‘Fundamentals of Environmental studies’ employs a multidisciplinary approach
to understand the environment from various disciplines, biology, engineering, social sciences, and management. This
course shall include topics on concepts of biosphere, natural heritage, climate change, community participation
towards conservation efforts, conservation politics, criteria for developing effective environmental policies, and
remedial measures to mitigate environmental problems. To provide real-world context, the course will include and
discuss several case-studies on environmental issues and concerns that India is currently facing. The course will be offered to both graduate and undergraduate students. Besides the prescribed evaluation
components, the graduate students will need to submit an additional term paper on an issue pertaining to the recent
environmental problems.

The course will explore this question of how phenomenal experience emerges from the physical stimulation of senses by light, sound, pressure and chemicals in the environment. We have specialised systems to process diverse forms of sensory information. The stimulation by light activates the visual system, and sound engages the auditory system, and so on. The course will track the entire process of perception, from the stimulation of the sensory receptors to the emergence of conscious experience. Students will learn the fundamentals of sensory transduction, neural coding of sensory information, and higher-order processes responsible for assimilating and interpreting sensory information. The students will then use this knowledge to read and reflect on research in the field of perception as well as use the conceptual knowledge towards tangible outcomes. The course will draw ideas from psychophysics, neuroscience, artificial intelligence and philosophy on perceiving the world around us.</span><br><br>

Although the course is located within SPS, it will also be of interest to students in PHL, and other majors, as it broadly deals with the making and applicability of concepts.       The course invites students from different disciplines to engage with the project of turning the ‘social’ into an object of inquiry. Building on the sense that though freely used in everyday life the word ‘social’ is little understood, the course will enable students to ask what makes a phenomena, a process, an event or a form of knowledge ‘social’. They will be able to ask and address questions such as, Do only human beings have society? How does one theorise something that is seemingly so near to us? And, why to theorise it in the first place? What is theory? Etc.       The course will open up these possibilities by introducing students to the various ways in which the ‘social’ has been broached and understood, particularly in the domain of inquiry we refer to as social theory. Students will learn to evaluate and apply theoretical perspectives to the world around them, and to appreciate both the possibilities and limitations of theorising as a way of understanding. The course has been designed in a way that students get a sense of the ‘social’ as a problem and not just as an abstract concept. They will get to see how various forms of social explanation developed in response to specific problems, and hence, how to assess them accordingly. The tensions and possibilities residing in each approach to the ‘social’ will be laid bare, enabling students to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each. They will be able to critically assess which of these approaches suits their own research interests best, and to use it productively and with awareness.       It is a reading intensive course and students will be expected to consistently work on challenging texts by major social theorists, anthropologists and historians. A typical class meeting will consist of lecturing, reading together as a class and discussion.   																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

It will be of interest to any student in the university who wishes to develop a qualitative, social and political perspective on climate change. It will broadly help students analyse how the phenomenon of climate change is impacted by and in turn impacts socio-cultural conditions.Thus, on one end, top-down, using political theory, we will analyse global governmental action on climate change. On the other end, bottom-up, we will use sociology/anthropology, to study how different communities use their traditional knowledge to adapt to climate change. From a climate justice perspective, we will ask why and how is it that marginalized groups across the world disproportionately bear both the impact of environmental degradation and the burden of remedial measures to avert the climate crisis. We will read case studies on a variety of climate related issues such as: on air-pollution in Delhi, on the inadequacies of our high school climate education, on how communities recover from climate disasters in Asia and in the US, and on how villagers co-exist with bears in Uttarakhand. Classes will combine texts with discussions, films, lectures and student projects both within and outside the classroom.                                                                                                                                                      At the end of the course, as students conceptualize for themselves what effective climate action should look like, the course will give them the tools to both critique the current economic and political measures being taken, and to appreciate the complexity of such interventions. 																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

This course is a major core for BA (Hon) in Economics, BS (Hon) in Computer Science and an elective course for BS-Physics (Hon).  The mathematical statistics course centres around case studies taken from different areas. Each case study has five parts: introduction, data, background, investigation and theory. Finding the answer to the questions raised in the case study motivates the study of related statistical theory. The mathematical treatment offers in-depth learning of statistical methods and prepares students to independently use standard statistical models and methods in specific contexts.   																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														         The course could provide the students with the skills to implement statistical models and methodologies while working with real data. This course would also be helpful for other quantitative sciences, engineering and management majors. The students will be working on group projects with data related to Economics, Physics, Biology, Engineering and Management.  																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

It can be chosen by all students, who are able to complete the prerequisites. Positive Psychology is the scientific enquiry of aspects of human experience which create and cultivate  joy and well-being. This growing and much delayed field of psychology exerts a very strong influence on several applied fields of psychology, which traditionally have been focused on what is ‘wrong’ with human experience. The present course will introduce the theory and practice of positive psychology which includes philosophical foundations of positive psychology, understandings of positive strengths and virtues, well-being through life span and applications. Alongside learning the theoretical concepts, the students will also have the opportunity to work through one’s own strengths through group projects. The course is designed with an applied orientation in intersections with health, clinical, counselling and sports psychology.  																																					 														            																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

																This course is the second of a set of two courses (other being SAN201) which initiates students into the discipline of reading original Sanskrit texts. Students have been introduced to the intricacies of Sanskrit morphology and syntax in SAN101 and SAN102, and students began to read original, albeit relatively simpler, texts in SAN201. This course SAN202 concludes two years of Sanskrit study at the University, and thereby aims to bring students to a level where they will be self-sufficient in being able to continue their journey in the vast world of classical Sanskrit poetry and prose.
																																					
														        In this course, students will read some important sections from two distinguished literary works: Kālidāsa’s Raghuvaṃśa and Bhartṛhari’s Nītiśataka. The Raghuvaṃśa is traditionally identified as one of the five mahākāvyas of Sanskrit literature and narrates the stories of kings belonging to the Raghu dynasty. The Nītiśataka is one of the three śatakas (centuries of verses) composed by the scholar-king Bharṭrhari, dealing primarily with ethics and morality. In their previous study, students have been introduced to the importance of Sanskrit commentaries and they will refer to Mallinātha’s Saṃjīvinī while studying the verses of the Raghuvaṃśa in this course. Students will also be introduced to the styles, meters and peculiar syntactical forms found in such Sanskrit literary texts. This course seeks also to reinforce another important aim – to contrast some English translations of these influential works with the original Sanskrit text, thereby demonstrating to students the inevitable gap in any work of translation (and the consequent intellectual joy in being able to read the original!).

																Theatre has evolved through time as an important tool of expression and communication.  It is not only a source of entertainment but can serve as a catalyst for social reform or development. Theatre also expands our connection to the larger world around us, and our empathy for lives lived differently from our own. A director or an actor thinks from the perspective of the diverse characters they portray, improving tolerance towards others in the society. The audience, in turn, becomes witness to worlds that they might otherwise not encounter or be familiar with. Studies have also shown that students who participate in theatre perform better in academics as it enhances their power to express themselves.This course aims to introduce students to the different forms and functions of theatre, inclusive of the wide range of roles theatre practitioners can take on, such as directing, acting and scriptwriting.  We will also simultaneously discuss how theatre relates to societal concerns, using theatre games to help students to find present day issues that are relevant to them. Importantly, we will work together on producing skits and script writing in peer groups to encourage students to work cohesively in groups, overcome their inhibitions and find the confidence to engage in creative self-expression.This course is at beginner level & doesn’t require prior theatre experience. It is open to all students at the University. It will run for  one session a week (for 3 hours) as in a lab course. It is offered by Kabir Thakore, the Director of the Scrapyard Theatre in Ahmedabad.

Hopefully many of us also agree that going ahead, the lens through which we see our planet must not be human-centric. Instead of pollution and selfishness can we dream of forests, birds, sounds and colours? Can we rectify historical inequalities and accept that we humans are not at the centre of all “need” cycles? Can we dream of a world where nature has been returned to nature? This field of thought (that questions what happens when you remove the human from the centre of all design and enquiry) is often termed posthumanism. And today artists are at the forefront of this kind of imagining. In this course, we will look at how contemporary art delves into posthumanism through a series of ‘thought experiments’ that question our understanding of subjects such as the divide between nature and humanity, of what being human really means, and what it means to create art that transcends humanism and embraces technology (think A.I.) and nature. Practically, each ‘experiment’ will last for one module. In each we will question a received idea and think about ways of seeing it using a diverse range of techniques and materials (selected by students according to their preference). Making art is a component of each module but the emphasis is more on conceptual work. For each thought experiment, we will not only create art but watch films and go outside the classroom to visit local artists engaging the above themes in their studios. We will discuss, see, create and think, and maybe, as a result, learn to see the world around us very differently. This is a 100 level course with 3 credits, and open to all the students in the University.																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

However, early in the 21st century, China and India are nation-states that are once again being seen as two emerging powers of the global economy. The rise of India and China has fundamentally altered the modern world, whether that be politically, economically, culturally, or sociologically. Both nations, with their gigantic populations and extensive resources, now command yet again a level of worldwide influence not seen since the mid-18th century. Although they share many similarities, there are also many differences in these two Asian countries’ development paths. This course aims to compare and contrast the two nations along several different axes.

modern and advanced concepts and methods in biochemistry that are at the center of cutting-edge
research in modern biology. The course will cover concepts in enzymology, informational pathways
in cells, integrative biochemistry , advanced methods in biochemistry and the role of biochemistry in
relation to key societal problems of human health, environment and food with a focus on future of
biochemistry. Enzymes are at the heart of biochemical reactions and also are a key component of
industrial applications of biochemistry. Enzymology section of this course will cover basic principles
of enzyme structure and function that will be highlighted through a few key examples. Themes in
enzyme regulation will be described along with an overview of modern methods to investigate
enzyme function. Informational pathways inside cells are based on the central dogma that involves
informational transfer from DNA to RNA. This section of the course will focus on metabolism of
DNA and RNA inside cells. DNA metabolism would cover replication, repair and recombination
whereas RNA metabolism would focus on transcription, RNA processing and RNA dependent
synthesis of DNA and RNA. Integrative biochemistry section of the course will focus on a systems-
level understanding of biochemical concepts at both a cellular as well as organismal level. This will
cover how lipid molecules come together to form biomembranes, how proteins inside a cell integrate
together to drive transport across membrane as well as transport inside cells. Integration of protein
networks into biochemical signaling pathways will also be described with a highlight on a few
signaling pathways that are of vital importance inside cells. Hormonal regulation and integration of
metabolic pathways will be dealt with a key focus on dysregulation leading to obesity and diabetes.
The fourth section of the course will be a thorough examination of some of the modern methods
that drive cutting-edge research in biology laboratories across the world. This section will cover a
diverse range of biochemical methods with a focus on basic principles and applications of the
method. These include cell fractionation and centrifugation, protein detection and protein-protein
interaction methods and the "omics" revolution in biology being driven by genomics, transcriptomics
and proteomics tools. In the final section of the course, the students will learn how the modern
concepts and methods in biochemistry are being applied to solve some of the pertinent societal
problems with respect to human health, climate change and the food crisis. This section will cover
concepts and case studies in medical biochemistry, environmental biochemistry and biochemistry
as applied to food science and nutrition. Finally, the course with end with a reflection on the future of
biochemistry and its role in solving some of the key human challenges in the future.

																Is being just good for the person who is just? If you had a magic ring that allowed you to steal and kill without being caught, would stealing and killing still be bad for you? According to Plato's Republic, the answer is yes! Injustice is bad for the unjust person. But to see why, we have to follow Plato through an exploration of the nature of the human soul, political community, knowledge, and reality itself. For example, we will investigate what knowledge is, what the purpose of political community is, and whether the soul is immortal. In this course we will read one of the greatest and most influential philosophical works of all time and address some of the fundamental questions of how to live, of knowledge, and of reality.

This is of utmost importance in learning how fundamental laws of Physics determine the various details of the world around us. The course is designed to ensure that the students also appreciate how, even though bulk matter is primarily made of microscopic degrees of freedom, its properties are fundamentally different from the properties of its constituent particles. This is also a course which is closest to applications to practical problems of interest to other disciplines such as chemistry, material science, engineering as well as to problems arising in the industry. </span><br><br>

The methods of engaging with humour will include multiple modes of improvisation, sketch comedy, and stand-up comedy, with each strand building upon the skills gained in the previous unit by emphasising questions of performativity and how to write scripts for performance. Simultaneously, the course will introduce  theoretical approaches that define, delineate, and distinguish what makes us laugh, and why. The course will also explore ways in which comedy shapes culture and social discourse and how public discourses are reframed through social constructions of race, gender, class, caste, sexuality, disability etc. as framed in comedy. </span><br><br>

										<td><br><span>Everybody has a story to tell. Stories captivate, entertain and motivate people. Storytelling is an age-old tradition that is also gaining popularity in the world of social media. Today the techniques are different, but the need to keep your audience, interviewer, reader, viewer, and the listener engaged till the end is of utmost importance. Being able to confidently tell your story at a gathering, a job interview, a business event, or on stage is a powerful and rewarding skill.
However, stories are almost always about celebrating men. Women characters in most stories are there only to take the “male narrative” forward. To redress this imbalance, the course aims at identifying and performing stories of Indian women: queens, dancers, teachers, scientists, bankers, rock stars, actors, village heads, dacoits, sports persons, mothers, and grandmothers.  The course will take the participants through the process of finding and choosing a story, shaping and distilling it into a tight script, and then applying stagecraft and presentation skills. In this course, the participants will be offered writing and performance tips and illustrated examples to assist them in developing their stories. Participants should walk away feeling they are ready to step onto any stage and tell their compelling story with confidence, knowing that it will be heard and remembered.

										<td><br><span>This course will enquire into the genres that have come to acquire the moniker “studio art” in contemporary art pedagogy. They include drawing, painting, sculpture, photography and printmaking. However, the category of "studio art" will be an entry point to think about spaces and sites beyond the studio per se and engage with broader questions of artistic productions spatially, temporally and politically. Indeed, contemporary art has pushed the boundaries of practices and sites of “studio art”, and this course will foreground this complex interplay between practice and space, in conjunction with social realities. Students will do hands-on projects in each genre that will form an introduction to specific studio art practices, while also learning their pre-modern and modern histories.

										<td><br><span>The course is designed to study the construction of a human figure in visual arts, specifically in drawing and painting. Through focus on concepts of ‘contour’, ‘gesture’ and ‘structure’, students will learn how to draw a human figure both from direct observation and from memory, while also understanding the significance of a human figure in the global history of art through intellectual discourse. Students will learn to render a human figure through in-depth study of skeletal structure and muscles by using mediums including graphite, charcoal and paint (acrylic) and also paper and canvas as support. 
																																					
														        Beginning with simple gestural drawings, the course will help students understand how one or more human figures work in a composition, while also exploring descriptive poses, moving action, and group poses. The studio sessions will be spent making drawings of human figures from direct observation, and reference images including images captured by students and artworks by master artists. The reference artworks by master artists will include the ones who drew and painted in a classical style and the ones who explored human figure beyond the conventions of traditional style and ventured into abstraction. 
There will be ongoing guidance and critique of works-in-progress, and discussions of finished works, which will touch upon concepts crucial to the creative process, including emphasis on hand-eye coordination, critical thinking, and spontaneity. This will also be supplemented with museum and gallery visits in Ahmedabad.
Sketchbooks will be an important component in this course; students will explore self-expression and alternative drawing methods as a part of their required initiative.</span><br><br>

The intensive focus of the course is on developing the core counseling skills (empathy, genuineness and unconditional positive regard) from person-centered approach of psychotherapy. These core conditions are integral part of any therapeutic relationship thus to embody these skills and learning to express them through role plays, practice sessions and classroom discussions is one of the primary objectives of this course.  
Students will learn how all skills arise from, and are directly related to, the counsellor’s development and strong therapeutic relationships. Some of the key skills that will be emphasized and practiced throughout the course are: therapeutic listening; communicating empathy; client conceptualizations; structuring sessions; using feedback; problem-solving skills in the session; providing psychoeducation and wrap-around services.

										<td><br><span>It is an introductory level course on Gujarati literature. It consists of a variegated and fascinating collection of easy to read Gujarati stories and poems written by a host of celebrated Gujarati writers and poets – Narsinh Mehta, Narmad, Govardhanram Tripathi, Kanhaiyalal Munshi, M K Gandhi, Pannalal Patel, Zaverchand Meghani, Umashankar Joshi, Mareez, Dhumketu, Joseph Macwan, Ramesh Parekh, Kundanika Kapadia, Raghuveer Chaudhary, Suresh Joshi, Himanshi Shelat, Neerav Patel, Dalpat Chauhan and a few more. Almost all selected texts have been translated into English; a parallel reading of the translation in English could make the Gujarati literary pieces more accessible. 
The course proposes to inspire a passion for reading literature, particularly vernacular literary texts; reading literature in one’s own first language is not only a source of happiness, but also ushers one into the understanding about the social, cultural, historical and/or political contexts.     
Since the course is offered in Gujarat and the city of Ahmedabad, one of the special perks the course participants will be able to gain from, will be the presence of contemporary writers and poets of Gujarat. Up to two to three sessions will host an Expert Talk to be delivered by a renowned literary figure whereby the course participants will be able to discuss the literary texts with the very writer/poet of the same, or benefit from a dialogue with an acclaimed writer/poet.      There are no specific courses as pre-requisites for this course, though it is expected that students have basic fluency in spoken and written Gujarati.</span><br><br>

But it is not that straight forward as, if the DNA in all cells are the same then how a liver cell decides to make a liver and not the skin. There should be some factors determining the number of genes to turn on and off depending on whether it’s a liver cell or the skin cell. Few sets of genes are turned on and off in making a liver cell a liver cell and a skin cell a skin cell and this is known as epigenome. Epigenetics is a set of hereditable changes in gene expression that takes place in the cells without changing the DNA sequence.This course deals with the epigenetics and the role of various epigenetic modifications   in the development and diseases. 																																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

This is a course to introduce the students to different aspects of control for mobile robots.  How to control them and make them move around safely and effectively. They start from the basis and finally will end up with a physical moving robot. In this path they will be familiarized with Kinematic and Dynamic of mobile robots, different aspects of robot perception, after a review of control theory and systems they will be introduced to hybrid automata and its components. They go through the theory behind localization and navigation which will lead them to motion planning, after which the practical part of the course will begin.  The robot building will bring up such topics as hardware and software used for making a mobile robot and running it. </span><br><br>

However, the techniques for analysing social networks can be extended to other non-social networks as well.In this course, we will learn about techniques for analysing networks, bothsocial and others, and also learn about how (algorithms) to do this in ascalable manner. Also, we will learn how to visualise some of these largenetworks. And lastly, we will also explore the applications of SNA in variousdomains such as Telecom, Biology, Economics, etc.We will discuss the following topics:- Graph Theory and Social Networks- Visualizing Social Networks- Game Theory- Network Dynamics- Information Networks and the World Wide Web- Applications of SNA in various domains																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

										<td><br><span> 																 																 																 																Computer vision (CV) is about extracting semantics and descriptions from the images or videos. This helps to analyze and understand the world around us. It allows visual perception in the Artificial Intelligence agent. CV occupies a significant importance in the fields of healthcare, mobility, security, entertainment, and robotics. The major thrust of the course will be to develop models and to put them in practice through algorithms on images and videos. This will translate ideas from theory to practice.The course is meant to cover recent advances in the domain of computer vision.  The course will gradually meander from low level computer vision to high level concepts. It will introduce tradition CV topics like filters, local image features and texture descriptors, then move to mid-level vision covering visual matching through Hough transform, optical flow. It ends up in high-level vision tasks like segmentation, tracking, classification, detecting objects and person recognition. 																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

										<td><br><span> 																 																 																 																In the digital era, the size and availability of data have ever been growing massively. Big Data comes with immense opportunity, but turning this seriously high volume, high velocity, structured or unstructured, heterogeneous, often noisy and high-dimensional data into something one can use is a huge challenge. This motivates increased interest in the design and analysis of algorithms for rigorous analysis of such data. In this course, we will consider algorithms for scenarios when the size of the data is too large to fit into the main memory of a single machine. Two main paradigms of computation that we will focus on are massively parallel computation and streaming algorithms.  The course will focus mainly on four aspects:  Module A. Streaming algorithms: Data streams represent a large dataset as an arriving online sequence of updates to its entries. The goal of algorithm design is to minimize the number of passes and space while achieving the bestt possible approximation guarantee.  Module B. Convex optimization and compressed sensing: The key focus of this module would be to understand the basics of optimization through the notion of Gradient descent. Furthermore, the concept of compressed sensing involving the operations on a huge sparse matrix will be covered. Module C. Massively parallel algorithms: In massively parallel computational systems (clusters) the data is partitioned between a large number of identical machines connected via a high-speed network. The goal of algorithm design in such a case is to minimize the number of synchronous rounds while optimizing the time/space, communication, approximation, etc.  Module D. Sublinear time algorithms: In this part, we will focus on algorithms, which have access to the entire dataset. However, the size of the data is prohibitively large so that we can only make a small number of carefully chosen queries to it. The goal of such algorithm design is to approximate interesting parameters of the dataset and study its properties while minimizing the number of queries and running time.   																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

But limited source of fossil fuels would not be capable to supply the demand in a sustainable way. Moreover, the implication of the use of these resources tends to have negative impacts on the environment. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop efficient renewable energy based technologies at an affordable cost. Solar energy is one of the promising resource among all the other renewable resources.  																 																																					 														        																					 														        Moreover, in recent years, to reduce energy generation from conventional resources, India also made huge progress on solar energy based power generation and many solar based projects are under development.  With an idea of increasing subject knowledge and exposure of the solar energy, Solar Thermal Energy subject will be offered as an elective course. The following is the syllabus of the subject:Unit-1 Earth & Sun Relationship: The Sun, Solar Radiation, Radiation Measurement, Sun-Earth Relationships, Empirical Equations for Predicting the Availability of Solar Radiation. Unit-2 Solar Collectors: Introduction, Flat plate collector, Performance analysis of a liquid flat plate collector (Transmissivity, Overall loss coefficient, Collector efficiency factor, Collector heat removal Factor), Concentrating collectors, Types of concentrating collectors, Performance analysis of concentrating collectors, Advantages and disadvantages of concentrating collectors over flat-plate type collectors.

										<td><br><span> 																 																 																 																 																 																 																 																 																 																It may be argued that democracy has emerged as the most desirable, if not the most successful, form of government in the contemporary world. Regardless of whether we like a particular democracy or not, arguments about what is the most legitimate and just form of rule point towards democracy. Why is democracy seen as the most just form of rule? How did such a situation come about historically? Is there evidence to show that, all things considered, democracies are indeed the most just form of government known to us?  Are there specific civic virtues that help democracies flourish? Is there a particular way in which agreement, dissent, cooperation, and conversation between different groups and individuals in a democratic society is to be carried out? Would democracy be a necessary component of a just system of government? And would social justice be a necessary component of democratic government?  These are some of the questions that this course will tackle. The entire course is built on two central ideas about democracy: a) how best to safeguard against arbitrary exercise of state power, and b) how best cultivate the virtue of democratic conversation. The course is divided into four taught modules and a fifth project module. Each of the four modules are built around a normative statement, which is supposed to provoke and organise the discussions within that module. The four normative statements are: Module 1: "Democracy is the most just form of government" Module 2: "Rights take precedence over popular will" Module 3:  "Inequality is antithetical to democracy” 																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

Issues such as depleting resources, climate extremes, land degradation, food insecurity, unsustainable consumption and unequal access to resources, pollution, ecosystem degradation and extinction of species have posed challenges of sustainability that span spatial and temporal scales. However, in the recent past, efforts related to conservation and sustainability have also increased manifold, paving the way for a slightly hopeful future. On the crossroads of these vectors, multiple questions such as: what are the sustainability challenges facing humanity? How do we measure environmental footprints? How do we assess uncertainties and risks? Who bears the burden of costs and risks? Can we make our consumption behavior sustainable? How do we create, replicate and upscale innovative ideas? How do we evolve a just governance system to share costs and benefits equitably?, etc. need to be addressed and answered. The millennials must be equipped to comprehend and answer these questions in a meaningful and an engaging manner. This course, through an integration of diverse domains - materials, data science, biology and life, behaviour, communication, and constitution and civilization, will expose students to 1. appreciate and develop an integrated understanding of these issues and their interactions, 2. 																 																																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

The course will explore ways of understanding the neighborhood in geographic, historical, cultural, governance terms, as well as its biodiversity, lifestyle and health profile, economic and social characteristics, and physical attributes among other aspects. The course begins with defining and conceptualising neighbourhood. Students would visualize the neighborhood using different thematic maps, and the evolution of cultural and social characteristics of the neighborhoods would be investigated. Analysis of demographic features, livelihood profiles, governance structures, and flow of services would enable students to appreciate modern neighbourhoods. Biodiversity would be explored to evaluate the biological richness of the neighbourhood. Health status and lifestyle of the individual in the neighborhood would be surveyed. Students would also get an opportunity to explore the physical nature of the neighbourhood. 																																					 														        The course will anchor hands-on learning activities in the contexts of a few local neighbourhoods. Students, working in groups, will observe and engage in surveying and document data on the above themes. Besides, students will get a broader perspective on demographic, economic and social characteristics from the population census data and health status from the CMIE economic outlook data.

The learning from this course would facilitate students to build a vision around the interplay of the environment, behaviour, and development associated with the neighbourhoods.																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

Both highlight the urgency for us to act - as citizens and as scientists. However, how much do we think of water? How much do we know of this resource apart from what we have read in our school textbooks? Is the water crisis real? Are we taking the right decisions today to secure a better future for the coming generations? How can I, as an individual and as a community participate in the process? Also, as the driver for all forms of life on earth, water is an excellent solvent, however, this excellent solvent’s characteristic, when combined with its flow, makes it a potent carrier of pollutants and pathogenic microorganisms that are often harmful to health. So, what makes water safe to consume and use for many other purposes? Is the water in surface and groundwater bodies in the Ahmedabad area safe for all forms of life? Is it potable? This course will turn students into aware citizens of the country by enabling them to ask relevant questions around the subject of water. 																 																 																 																																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>

It is important to give young people access to volunteering opportunities. If these opportunities can be linked to their curriculum, they gain an integrated way of doing this. The value of blending community service and a liberal education can be manifold.This course gives an opportunity to students to participate and get involved in non-profit/non-governmental organisations across the city. Physical work is stressed as it gives students a chance to step into new situations and contexts. The Student Volunteer Programme at Ahmedabad University aims to provide the student community an intense, authentic and meaningful experience in giving, voluntary service and  building citizenship. Please read more about the programme in the document 'Student Volunteer Programme' on the AURIS portal, under University Resources --> Documents/Policies/Forms. 																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        																					 														        </span><br><br>
