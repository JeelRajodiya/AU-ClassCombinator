Firms have choices to make if they are to survive and prosper. Those which are strategic include: how to create value, the selection of goals, the choice of products and services to offer; the design and configuration of policies determining how the firm positions itself to compete in product-markets (i.e., competitive strategy); the choice of an appropriate level of scope and diversity; the different options in terms of directions and methods of growth - including coopetition. The course also covers the role and impact of technology on modern-day businesses, viz. how technology impacts organizations and how tech-based businesses strategize. Later, we will learn about opportunity identification with a Blue Ocean Strategy approach, before moving onto the last module of the course which focuses on strategy implementation.  ,",

An organization with a project culture is one that knows where it is going, is focused on results and has a professional team who knows what is expected of them. Professionals & organizations working or desiring to start a new venture in diverse fields require an understanding and insight of Project Management concepts and methods. Projects are vital and often businesses and various functions start with this management operation. Initial activities within a function also start with projects, for eg. Launching a new product in the market or implementing ERP within the organisation. The products are developed at lab scale, tried at pilot scale and produced at plant scale. To handle all these activities later in their careers, management students have to learn Project Management techniques and through planning and control techniques to execute projects. ,",

        "Description": "An annual report is a powerful and revealing document about a company\u2019s financial standing. To a trained professional it gives a substantial insight into where a company may be headed in the future. However, to an untrained eye the annual report may seem like walls of accounting technicalities provided to fill space between the glossy photos and the upbeat messages from the CEO. In many aspects, reading an annual report could be a daunting task as it is a mixture of factual financial results and public relation information. There is a wide communication gap between the world of compliance and disclosure. It is difficult to interpret and understand the information provided in slick expensively produced annual reports. There can be no better piece of information about a company than annual reports but it is essential to cut through the marketing clutter in annual reports and extract vital information (financial content) that shows true picture of the company.",

        "Description": "'Business-model' is a buzz word now in boardrooms, especially when the business encounters problems. The managers agree or disagree if the present business model is working any more or it needs navigation. To put it simply, a business model is both a short- and long-term framework of plans and moral rules within which a business operates. If the business model is strong it creates value and business prospers. Reverse happens when the business model is week. Over a period of time, an existing business calibrates its business model in keeping with the surrounding changes to remain relevant otherwise it may perish. A carefully designed business model has an inherent strength but it may not be long lasting. Hence, calibration is necessary from time to time. A rightly calibrated business model can act as a game changer. Today\u2019s business models were imagined a decade ago and we have to create tomorrow\u2019s business model considering many unknown bets.  Therefore, formal education and intelligent hard work are necessary to create a winning business model. Even though there are some generic and popular business models developed by experts, the owners and managers can bypass the standard ones and create a differentiated business model most suited to their businesses. This course mainly deals with identifying and placing various business drivers in sequence and changing it whenever and wherever necessary in order to make competitive business models.\u00a0,",

So, why do so many products and services fail to achieve this ideal? All products, whether digital or otherwise, must deliver a high-quality user experience or risk losing users to competitors.The focus of interaction design is on user-centred design based on the understanding of real users including their experiences, goals, needs, wants and tasks. The goal of interaction design is also to collect and analyse data to make informed interface design decisions which are critical to creating and delivering successful products, services and systems that fulfil the user/customer, technological and business needs. ,",

It brings the power of computational analysis to problems and possibilities in humanities and related disciplines.\u00a0This course aims to inform students of transdisciplinary research being undertaken within the purview of DH to equip them with the ability to hypothesise and 'critically-make' new media projects.The students are expected to incorporate a 50:50 ratio in their study of theory and implementing solutions hands-on. Students will be guided to prototype solutions that bridge their primary field of study with the Humanities. The course will result in the culmination of a final project answering a research question. Students will engage closely in a project that results in the culmination of a DH-platform as part of their evaluation.The tools that will primarily be used are Python, Google Collab, miscellaneous OpenAccess methods for text, network, spatial analyses will be encouraged. Students need not have any prior knowledge of these tools to register for this course. The coursework would broadly involve the creation of a data essay, a piece of alternative or multimodal writing and towards the development of an OpenAccess digital platform to highlight digital scholarship in Indian galleries, libraries, archives and museums (GLAM) for he general public.,",

Professionals & organizations working or desiring to start a new venture in diverse fields require an understanding and insight of Project Management concepts and methods. Projects are vital and often businesses and various functions start with this management operation. Initial activities within a function also start with projects, for e.g. Launching a new product in the market or implementing ERP within the organisation. The products are developed at lab scale, tried at pilot scale and produced at plant scale.\u00a0 To handle all these activities later in their careers, management students have to learn Project Management techniques and through planning and control techniques to execute projects.,",

        "Description": "This course would deal with how economic rationale can be applied to problems regarding the environment. Two prominent issues would be use of open-access natural resources (where property rights are not well defined) and environmental public good provision. Apart from coming up with instruments to deal with these problems, the course would also discuss about market failures related to pollution. The study of the concepts and techniques of environmental valuation would be important. Topics covered would include those related to development and sustainability: the degree of substitutability between natural resources and produced forms of capital (namely physical and human) and limits to growth implied by it. Since economic growth of developing nations often involves rising pollution, the course would also spend some time on discussing the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC). The course concludes with \u201cgreening\u201d the system of national accounts and attempts to include value of environmental services within the national product of countries (including the case for India). The course would be based on rigorous theory, readings of texts and articles and numerical examples.,",

It aims to build upon the important accounting concepts and principles including revenue recognition, inventory, depreciation, and understanding the accounting equation. The course focuses initially on how to record economic events in the accounting records (i.e., bookkeeping and accrual accounting) and how to prepare and interpret the primary financial statements that summarize a firm's economic transactions (i.e., the balance sheet, the income statement, and the statement of cash flows). The course adopts a decision-maker perspective of accounting by emphasizing the relation between accounting data and the underlying economic events that generated them thereby enabling the students to read, understand and analyse financial statements through ratio analysis. The course also explores the areas of financial shenanigans wherein the students will be able to learn how companies use financial statements to disguise economic reality.,",

In this sense, organisations are not merely seen as a place where communication happens, but it exists because employees communicate and create the sense in the existing structure. Also, the idea of the workplace has moved beyond the simple \"office space\" to \"living social networks\" that combine work, home and play. Moreover, organisations use their website and social media to communicate with internal and external stakeholders. Viewed, thus, in this context, the course looks at the constitutive view of communication and intends to familiarise students with workplace communications as practised in the corporate world. The course is interdisciplinary and involves the combination of concepts (communication, sociology and computer-mediated technology) into one project. ,",

Those who engage in these negative behaviors generally are aware that their actions can cause harm to others, their employer, and/or to them; hence, the instigator usually has intent. It is essential for tomorrow\u2019s managers to understand what are these behaviors how some times they may lead to functional outcomes, sometimes it may lead to nehative outcomes as well. It is essential that we understand these behaviors, as well as control, prevent, mitigate, or ameliorate their occurrences.

The course covers three themes drawing high attention from the governments as well as other stakeholders including civil society and businesses. Conventionally the three themes; energy, environment and sustainability; are perceived through the lens of trade-offs. This perspective is changing in recent times. Policymakers, professionals and civil society actors are cooperating to align strategies and actions across themes to overcome societal and individual risks and to gain co-benefits and comparative advantage. In many environmentally proactive entities, \u201csustainability\u201d is a core issue that is increasingly integrated with organizational processes, systems and strategies. Delineation of policies to align energy, environment and sustainability is a highly explored subject drawing interest from researchers and practitioners. The course is divided into four modules which combine distinct yet inter-related concepts around the three central themes. The sessions cover the landscape ranging from global, national to local, spanning technologies, management and concepts from social sciences and ecology.\u00a0,",

Digital is no longer a grey area. It becomes inevitable that the brand language be effectively transformed from one media to another without changing the brand image. Throughout this course, the focus would be to expose students to ideas, applications, experiences and opportunities that are relevant to today\u2019s times. This course is primarily about creating visual artefacts that communicate effectively, but that does not mean you need to be an artist to succeed. Assessment will focus upon your efforts and your willingness to engage with your classmates to provide feedback and learn from one another. The more time you spend with the exercises in this course, the more skills you will develop as a visual communicator. Take the time to explore each exercise, take risks, and reiterate often. Don\u2019t allow your first attempt at any solution to be your only attempt. Fail early and fail often. Learning what doesn\u2019t work is an essential process in understanding what does work. This course is open for students who are admitted to any programme at the University.    ,",

The course takes a positivist approach of explaining economic policymaking, assuming all agents are rational and behave strategically, focusing on various kinds of incentives and constraints the policy-makers face under different political systems. The course will cover topics like Probabilistic Voting, Median Voter\u2019s Theorem, Downsian Model of Electoral Competition, politics of redistribution over pensions and unemployment insurance, politics of special interest over local public goods and lobbying, separation of power through political institutions, presidential versus parliamentary political regimes etc.  ,",

Students will also be introduced to Sanskrit commentaries and their role in textual interpretation. We will also consider some English translations of these works and compare them to the original Sanskrit text, understanding thereby the inevitable gap in any work of translation (and the intellectual joy therefore in being able to read the original!).,",

        "Description": "The course trains students to perform laboratory-based experiments to study human behaviour. The course deals with experimental techniques required to study perceptual, cognitive and social psychological processes. The emphasis is on providing students with hands-on experience in conceiving, designing, executing and interpreting psychological experiments. The course aims to help students to apply their conceptual knowledge in psychological processes into creating novel experiments. The course offers hands-on training in experimentation on human participants. The theoretical principles and paradigmatic fundamentals associated with each experimental technique are also discussed during the session. The course focuses on five psychological processes, and students will learn to replicate recent experiments that probe these processes.\u00a0,",

While drawing is often seen as a primary tool supporting creative research within art practice, this course will also consider drawing as an independent and intimate approach that offers a keen insight to both the creative process and one\u2019s emotional state. To that end, it is a studio-practice course aided by strong contextual studies that will enable students to develop basic rendering skills, understand drawing as a form of action and gesture that is an affirmation of life. Students will be able to objectively perceive the world we live in, which forms the crux of art-making in any art form \u2013 including printmaking, photography, painting, and digital art.",

The methods of engaging with humour will include multiple modes of improvisation, sketch comedy, and stand-up comedy, with each strand building upon the skills gained in the previous unit by emphasising questions of performativity and how to write scripts for performance. Simultaneously, the course will introduce  theoretical approaches that define, delineate, and distinguish what makes us laugh, and why. The course will also explore ways in which comedy shapes culture and social discourse and how public discourses are reframed through social constructions of race, gender, class, caste, sexuality, disability etc. as framed in comedy.\u00a0,",

We begin with how animals learn and communicate with each other, then move on to discuss how they find food, avoid predators, choose their mates, and rear their offspring. This course is aimed at anyone looking to broaden their understanding of animal behaviour beyond nature documentaries or a typical high school education. No previous knowledge is required, only curiosity and enthusiasm for the subject.,",
